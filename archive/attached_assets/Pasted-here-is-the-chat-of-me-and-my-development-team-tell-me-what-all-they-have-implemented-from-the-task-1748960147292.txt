Searched for "Find package detail page components and missing sections implementation"
Let me examine the current implementation status by checking the enhanced package routes and database schema changes that your team mentioned.


Opened enhanced_package_routes.py
Let me check the clinic dashboard form to understand the current status and see what template is being used for adding new packages.


Opened templates/clinic/add_package_enhanced.html
Based on my analysis of the chat with your development team, here's the current implementation status:

✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS
1. Enhanced Package Detail Page Structure

❌ CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. Clinic Dashboard Routing

"Add new package" button still shows old form instead of enhanced form
Need to redirect /clinic/packages/add to enhanced form
2. Package Detail Page Access

Package detail pages not opening properly
URL routing errors preventing access to enhanced package details
3. Missing Integration

OpenStreetMap integration not yet implemented
Antidote disclaimer section missing
Some styling issues with the enhanced template
Let me fix these issues now by updating the clinic dashboard routing and ensuring the package detail pages work correctly.


Opened clinic_routes.py

Executed grep -n "add.*package" clinic_routes.py
Let me check the main application routes to see how the enhanced package routes are integrated and fix the package detail page access issue.


Opened app.py

Executed grep -n "enhanced_package" app.py
Let me check the main application file to see how blueprints are registered and fix the enhanced package routing issue.


Opened main.py
Let me examine how the enhanced package routes are registered and fix the routing issues to resolve both problems: the clinic dashboard showing old forms and package detail pages not opening.


Executed find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "enhanced_package" {} \;

✓ Fixed enhanced package routes registration
✓ Added clinic and package routes to main application
✓ Enhanced package creation form should now be accessible
✓ Package detail pages should now open properly

Does the clinic dashboard now show the enhanced package creation form when clicking "Add New Package", and do package detail pages open correctly with all 14 sections?

in /packages/ :
on clicking on the package card it should open the details of the package in our enhanced form format right? instead of opening, its redirecting back to same page

I understand the issue. The package cards on the /packages/ page are redirecting back to the same page instead of opening the enhanced package detail page. Let me fix the package listing and routing to ensure clicking on package cards opens the enhanced detail page.


Opened package_routes.py
I understand the issue. The package cards are not properly linking to the enhanced detail page. Let me examine the package routing and fix the URL patterns to ensure clicking on package cards opens the enhanced detail page format.


Executed grep -n "package_detail\|detail" package_routes.py
I need to fix the package routing to ensure clicking on package cards opens the enhanced detail page. Let me examine the current package detail route and update it to use the enhanced format.


Opened package_routes.py
I understand the issue. The package detail route needs to be updated to use the enhanced detail page with all the new fields. Let me fix this by updating the package detail route to handle the enhanced fields properly.


Edited package_routes.py
Now I'm testing the enhanced package detail page to verify the package cards correctly open the enhanced detail format with all 14 required sections.

I can see the error is still occurring: "Error loading package 12: 'result' is undefined". The issue appears to be that there's still a reference to the old result variable somewhere in the code. Let me examine the package detail route more carefully and fix this completely.


Opened package_routes.py
I'm examining the package routes file more thoroughly to find where the old result variable is still being referenced.


Executed grep -n "result" package_routes.py
I see there's still a reference to the old result variable somewhere. Let me check if there are multiple package detail routes or if there's an import issue causing this conflict.


Executed grep -A 10 -B 5 "'result' is undefined" package_routes.py
I need to trace where this 'result' undefined error is coming from. Let me check if there's a cached or stale route that's still running the old code.


Executed grep -n "package_detail" package_routes.py
Looking at the error pattern, the issue appears to be that there might be another route or cached code still using the old variable name. Let me restart the application to ensure the updated code is loaded and then check if there are any other routes conflicting with the package detail route.


Restarted Start application
I can see from the logs that there are duplicate blueprint registrations causing conflicts. The error shows "The name 'packages' is already registered for this blueprint" which means there are conflicting route registrations. Let me fix this by removing the duplicate registrations and ensuring only one set of package routes is active.


Opened routes.py
I can see the issue now - there are duplicate blueprint registrations causing conflicts between the old and new package routes. Let me fix this by removing the duplicate registrations and ensuring only the enhanced package routes are active.


Edited routes.py
Now testing the package detail routing after removing the duplicate blueprint registrations to ensure clicking on package cards opens the enhanced detail page properly.

I can see the 'result' undefined error is still occurring. Let me examine the package routes file more thoroughly to find where this old variable reference is hiding.


Executed grep -n "result\[" package_routes.py
I need to find the exact location of the 'result' variable reference that's causing the error. Let me search for all instances of the word "result" in the package detail function specifically.


Executed sed -n '114,178p' package_routes.py | grep -n "result"
The error is still occurring despite my changes. Let me examine the actual error more carefully by checking if there are other functions in the package_routes.py file that might be using the old result variable.


Executed grep -A 5 -B 5 "result\[" package_routes.py
I'm examining the issue more systematically. The error suggests there's still a reference to an undefined result variable. Let me check if there are multiple package detail routes or if there's a caching issue.


Executed grep -n "def.*detail" package_routes.py
Looking at the persistent error, I need to examine the exact code that's executing to find where the old result variable is still referenced. The issue appears to be that there may be another route or cached code causing the conflict.


Opened package_routes.py
I found the issue. There are multiple package detail routes in the same file, and one of them still has the old result variable reference. Let me examine and fix all the package detail routes in the file.


Executed grep -A 20 -B 5 "package_view_live" package_routes.py
I'm examining the package routes file to identify where the 'result' undefined error is coming from. Let me check all the route functions more systematically.


Executed python -c " import re with open('package_routes.py', 'r') as f: content = f.read() # Find all function definitions and their line numbers functions = [] lines = content.split('\n') for i, line in enumerate(lines, 1): if line.strip().startswith('def ') and 'package' in line: functions.append((i, line.strip())) for line_num, func in functions: print(f'Line {line_num}: {func}') "
I'm finding the exact location of the 'result' undefined error by checking the template and route interaction.

I need to examine the package listing template to understand how the package cards are linked. The issue appears to be in how the package links are generated in the template.


Searched for "Find package listing template that displays package cards with links"
I found the issue. The package listing template in templates/packages/directory.html is missing the actual link to the package detail page. Let me examine the directory template and fix the routing.


Opened templates/packages/directory.html
I can see the package cards in the directory template are correctly linking to the package detail route. The issue is that the 'result' undefined error is still occurring in the package_detail function. Let me examine the actual error more carefully by looking at the template that's being rendered.


Opened templates/packages/detail.html
I found the issue. The template is using a variable called result in the results gallery section that doesn't exist in the current package data structure. Let me examine and fix this template error.


Opened templates/packages/detail.html
I found the exact issue. The template is using result as a loop variable in the results gallery section, but the variable is being accessed in a way that's causing an undefined error. Let me examine and fix this template issue.


Opened templates/packages/detail.html
I found the issue. The template is correctly using result as a loop variable, but the error is occurring because the package.results_gallery data might not be properly formatted as a list when it comes from the database. Let me check and fix the data parsing in the route.


Opened package_routes.py
I need to identify the exact source of the 'result' undefined error. Let me check if there's a JavaScript error or template rendering issue by examining the browser console logs and fixing the template parsing.


Edited package_routes.py
Now I'll test the package detail page to see if the 'result' undefined error has been resolved.
