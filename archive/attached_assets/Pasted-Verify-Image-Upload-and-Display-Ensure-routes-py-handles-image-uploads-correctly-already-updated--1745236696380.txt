Verify Image Upload and Display:
Ensure routes.py handles image uploads correctly (already updated, but confirm):
```python
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
@web.route('/dashboard/community/create', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def create_thread():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.form['title']
        content = request.form['content']
        category_id = request.form['category_id']
        new_thread = Community(title=title, content=content, category_id=category_id, author_id=current_user.id)
        if 'image' in request.files:
            file = request.files['image']
            if file and file.filename:
                filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
                file.save(os.path.join('static/media', filename))
                new_thread.photo_url = filename
        db.session.add(new_thread)
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('web.community_dashboard'))
    return render_template('create_thread.html', categories=Category.query.all())
Confirm community_thread_detail.html displays the image:

html

Copy
{% if thread.photo_url %}
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='media/' + thread.photo_url) }}" alt="Thread Image" style="max-width: 300px;">
{% endif %}
Test: Upload a test JPG in the create form, submit, and verify the image appears on the thread page.

Fix Persistent "John Smith" Author Name:
Check if thread.user is resolving correctly. If user is None, it might fall back to a default. Update models.py to ensure the relationship is bidirectional:

python

Copy
class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    # ... other fields ...
    threads = db.relationship('Community', backref='user', lazy=True)
Re-run the template updates to ensure all instances of thread.user.name are replaced with thread.user.username:

bash

Copy
sed -i 's/thread.user.name/thread.user.username/g' templates/*.html
Test: Log in with your Google account, create a thread, and confirm your username (not "John Smith") appears.

Validate Username Display Across Pages:
Verify community.html, community_thread_detail.html, dashboard_community.html, and reply_template.html all use {{ thread.user.username if thread.user else 'Anonymous' }}.
Test: Check /community and /dashboard/community to ensure all author names are usernames.

Test and Validate:
Restart the application.
Navigate to /dashboard/community, click "Create Thread," upload a test JPG, fill in title and content, select a category, and submit. Verify the new thread appears with the image and your username.
Check /community to ensure all threads (including the new one) show usernames, not "John Smith."
Navigate to /community/thread/3, confirm the media preview works, and check author names.
Take screenshots of the create form (with image upload), the new thread (with image), /community (with usernames), and the console (F12).
Generate logs for the create action (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Creating thread).

Provide Output:
Share updated routes.py, create_thread.html, edit_thread.html, community.html, community_thread_detail.html, dashboard_community.html, reply_template.html, models.py (if modified), logs, console output, and screenshots.
Respond to Replit’s question: "Yes, everything is displaying usernames correctly in the community section. Image upload and preview are working properly—please review the screenshots and logs to confirm.
