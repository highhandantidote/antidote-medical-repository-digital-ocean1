Finalize Testing Output and Transition to AI Phase with Scalable Recommendations:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Verify `test_report.md` includes all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics (page load times, API response times) for the current 5 procedures.
   - Ensure logs (e.g., `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`) contain relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Confirm screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community.

2. Implement Initial AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Use the existing 5 procedures (Rhinoplasty, Facelift, Eyelid Surgery, Botox, Lip Fillers) as a starting point, and prepare for scaling to 100 additional procedures.
   - Steps:
     - Create a new file `ai_recommendations.py` to house the model.
     - Use a simple similarity-based approach (e.g., cosine similarity on procedure features like `body_area`, `category`, `min_cost`, `max_cost`) since we lack user interaction data yet. (Note: This is a similarity-based model, not collaborative filtering, due to no user data.)
     - Example code:
       ```python
       from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
       import numpy as np
       from models import Procedure
       import joblib

       def get_recommendations(procedure_id):
           # Load or compute similarity matrix
           try:
               similarity_matrix = joblib.load('similarity_matrix.pkl')
               procedures = Procedure.query.all()
           except:
               procedures = Procedure.query.all()
               features = [[1 if p.body_area == "Face" else 0, 1 if p.category == "Surgical" else 0, p.min_cost, p.max_cost] for p in procedures]
               similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(features)
               joblib.dump(similarity_matrix, 'similarity_matrix.pkl')
           idx = [p.id for p in procedures].index(procedure_id)
           similar_indices = similarity_matrix[idx].argsort()[::-1][1:4]  # Top 3 similar
           return [procedures[i] for i in similar_indices]

       # Example usage
       if __name__ == "__main__":
           recs = get_recommendations(1)  # Assuming ID 1 is Rhinoplasty
           for p in recs:
               print(f"Recommended: {p.procedure_name}")
Add 100 more procedures to the database with realistic but random data (e.g., varying body_area, category, min_cost, max_cost between $300-$25,000) by updating test_minimal_data.py or a new script.
Cache the similarity matrix using joblib to avoid recomputation and Replit timeouts, updating it only when procedures change.
Integrate the recommendation function into routes.py (e.g., add a /recommendations/<procedure_id> endpoint or embed in /procedures).
Update procedure.html to display the top 3 recommended procedures below each procedure listing.
Test the model with both 5 and 105 procedures, logging results (e.g., DEBUG:ai:Recommended Facelift for Rhinoplasty).
Provide Output:
Share updated test_report.md, ai_recommendations.py, test_minimal_data.py (or new script), routes.py, procedure.html, logs, console output, and screenshots showing recommendations for both 5 and 105 procedures.
Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed and performance metrics included—please review test_report.md, logs, and screenshots. Initial AI tool for procedure recommendations implemented using a similarity-based model on 5 procedures, scaled to 105 with 100 additional procedures. Model tested successfully with caching—please review ai_recommendations.py and screenshots. Data can be cleaned with cleanup_test_data.py. Next, enhance the AI with community analytics to identify trending threads, using the 5 existing threads."
