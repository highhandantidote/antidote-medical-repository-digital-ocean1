In my Flask app Antidote, clicking "User Dashboard" or "My Dashboard" redirects to the homepage (/) instead of /dashboard/user/10 for testuser@antidote.com, despite fixing hardcoded IDs and adding debug logging. Verify and fix this to ensure the dashboard displays correctly:

1. Check debug logs to diagnose the redirection:
   - Restart the application:
     Restarted Start application
   - Log in as `testuser@antidote.com` with password "password123" (already logged in).
   - Navigate to the homepage (/), click "Dashboards" > "User Dashboard" or "Account" > "My Dashboard".
   - Check the debug logs:
     tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log
   - Look for lines like "Session user_id:", "Current user:", "Reviews fetched:", "Favorites fetched:" to confirm `current_user.id` and the queries.

2. Verify the rendered links in the browser:
   - Right-click the "User Dashboard" link in the "Dashboards" dropdown and select "Inspect" to see the generated href (e.g., should be /dashboard/user/10).
   - Right-click the "My Dashboard" link in the "Account" dropdown and inspect the href.
   - Take a screenshot of the inspected links.

3. Fix any session or route issues if logs indicate problems:
   - Open routes/web.py
   - If `current_user.id` is None or mismatched, ensure Flask-Login is properly configured:
     from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, logout_user, current_user, login_required
     login_manager = LoginManager()
     login_manager.init_app(app)
     login_manager.login_view = 'web.login'
     @login_manager.user_loader
     def load_user(user_id):
         return db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,)).fetchone()
   - Update the route if needed (already has login_required):
     @app.route('/dashboard/user/<int:id>')
     @login_required
     def user_dashboard(id):
         print("Session user_id:", session.get('_user_id'))
         print("Current user:", current_user.is_authenticated, getattr(current_user, 'id', None))
         if current_user.id != id:
             print("Redirecting to current user’s dashboard:", current_user.id)
             return redirect(url_for('web.user_dashboard', id=current_user.id))
         user = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (id,)).fetchone()
         if not user:
             return "User not found", 404
         reviews = db.execute("SELECT r.*, p.procedure_name, d.name AS doctor_name FROM reviews r "
                             "LEFT JOIN procedures p ON r.procedure_id = p.id "
                             "LEFT JOIN doctors d ON r.doctor_id = d.id "
                             "WHERE r.user_id = %s", (id,)).fetchall()
         print("Reviews fetched:", reviews)
         favorites = db.execute("SELECT f.*, d.name AS doctor_name FROM favorites f "
                               "JOIN doctors d ON f.doctor_id = d.id "
                               "WHERE f.user_id = %s", (id,)).fetchall()
         print("Favorites fetched:", favorites)
         return render_template('dashboard_user.html', user=user, reviews=reviews, favorites=favorites)
   - Save the file.

4. Test the user dashboard:
   - Log in as `testuser@antidote.com` with password "password123" (already logged in).
   - Navigate to the homepage (/), click "Dashboards" > "User Dashboard" or "Account" > "My Dashboard":
     - Confirm it navigates to /dashboard/user/10 without redirecting to /.
   - On /dashboard/user/10:
     - Confirm the "User Profile" tab displays the username (e.g., "testuser" or email).
     - Switch to the "My Reviews" tab, confirm reviews (e.g., "Amazing procedure!", "Highly recommend this doctor!") are displayed.
     - Switch to the "Saved Items" tab, confirm saved doctors (e.g., Dr. John Smith) are displayed.
     - Take a screenshot of /dashboard/user/10 showing all tabs.
   - Navigate to /doctors/detail/3:
     - Write another review (rating 4, comment "Excellent service!") and save the doctor (if not already saved).
     - Return to /dashboard/user/10 and confirm the new review and saved item appear.

5. Check for errors:
   - F12 > Console and Network tabs on /dashboard/user/10 (screenshot if errors remain).
   - Run: tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log and report issues, including debug logs.

6. Provide a summary:
   - Confirm the "User Dashboard" and "My Dashboard" links navigate to /dashboard/user/10.
   - Confirm the dashboard displays the username, reviews, and saved items.
   - Include the screenshot from step 4 and the inspected links from step 2.
   - Note any errors or debug log issues from step 5.
   - Suggest next steps (e.g., fix validation visibility, star rating animations).

Run this prompt and share the summary with the screenshots. Let’s resolve the redirection and ensure the dashboard works!
