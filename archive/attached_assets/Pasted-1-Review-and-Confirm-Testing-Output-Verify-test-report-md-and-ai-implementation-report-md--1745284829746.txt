1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Verify `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md` include all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics (page load times, API response times) for the 16 procedures.
   - Ensure logs (e.g., `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`) contain relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Confirm screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community.

2. Update Existing Schema to RealSelf Hierarchy:
   - Modify the `Procedure` model in `models.py` to align with the RealSelf structure, using the current schema:
     - Rename `body_area` to `body_part` (e.g., Face, Breast).
     - Rename `category_type` to `tags` (ARRAY of strings) to store Surgical/Non-Surgical tags, migrating data from the old `category_type` (e.g., "Surgical" becomes ["Surgical"]).
     - Repurpose the existing `category` column (currently empty) to hold broad treatment focuses (e.g., Rhinoplasty, Breast Augmentation), populating it during migration.
     - Example updated model:
       ```python
       class Procedure(db.Model):
           __tablename__ = 'procedures'
           id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
           body_part = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)  # e.g., Face
           category = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # e.g., Rhinoplasty
           procedure_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # e.g., Open Rhinoplasty
           tags = db.Column(db.ARRAY(db.String(20)))  # e.g., ["Surgical"]
           min_cost = db.Column(db.Integer)
           max_cost = db.Column(db.Integer)
Perform a single database migration using Flask-Migrate to apply these renames:
flask db migrate -m "Update to RealSelf hierarchy with minimal changes" and flask db upgrade.
Migrate the existing 16 procedures to the new structure, using current body_area and category_type:
Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face, category=Rhinoplasty, procedure_name=Open Rhinoplasty, tags=["Surgical"].
Facelift: body_part=Face, category=Facelift, procedure_name=Full Facelift, tags=["Surgical"].
Eyelid Surgery: body_part=Face, category=Eyelid Surgery, procedure_name=Upper Eyelid Surgery, tags=["Surgical"].
Botox: body_part=Face, category=Injectables, procedure_name=Botox Injections, tags=["Non-Surgical"].
Lip Fillers: body_part=Face, category=Injectables, procedure_name=Lip Filler Injections, tags=["Non-Surgical"].
For the 11 added procedures, assign varied body_part (e.g., Breast, Body, Skin), category (e.g., Breast Augmentation, Liposuction), and tags (e.g., ["Surgical"], ["Non-Surgical"]) based on existing body_area and category_type, updating via a SQL script or add_procedures_small.py.
Enhance add_procedures_small.py to add 84 more procedures (total 100 new, reaching 116), with diverse body_part (e.g., Breast, Body, Skin, Legs), category (e.g., Breast Augmentation, Tummy Tuck), procedure_name (e.g., Silicone Implants, Laser Hair Removal), and random tags (Surgical/Non-Surgical) and min_cost/max_cost ($300-$25,000), ensuring no new files are created.
Refine AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
Update ai_recommendations.py to use the new schema, correcting the collaborative filtering label to similarity-based (no user data yet):
Example code:
python

Copy
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np
from models import Procedure
import joblib

def get_recommendations(procedure_id):
    try:
        similarity_matrix = joblib.load('similarity_matrix.pkl')
        procedures = Procedure.query.all()
    except:
        procedures = Procedure.query.all()
        features = [[1 if p.body_part == "Face" else 0, 1 if p.category == "Rhinoplasty" else 0, 
                     1 if "Surgical" in p.tags else 0, p.min_cost, p.max_cost] for p in procedures]
        similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(features)
        joblib.dump(similarity_matrix, 'similarity_matrix.pkl')
    idx = [p.id for p in procedures].index(procedure_id)
    similar_indices = similarity_matrix[idx].argsort()[::-1][1:4]  # Top 3 similar
    return [procedures[i] for i in similar_indices]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recs = get_recommendations(1)  # Assuming ID 1 is Open Rhinoplasty
    for p in recs:
        print(f"Recommended: {p.procedure_name}")
Ensure caching with joblib to handle 116 procedures and avoid Replit timeouts.
Verify routes.py integration (e.g., /procedure_detail) uses the updated function, building on the existing endpoint.
Confirm procedure_detail.html displays recommendations, adjusting for body_part, category, and tags.
Define and Implement Category Visualization:
Visualize the RealSelf hierarchy in the UI, using existing templates:
Body Part: Display as main navigation tabs or a sidebar (e.g., “Face,” “Breast,” “Body”) in base.html or /procedures, allowing users to filter by anatomical region, similar to RealSelf’s top-level navigation.
Category: Show as sub-sections or a dropdown under each body_part (e.g., under “Face,” list “Rhinoplasty,” “Facelift,” “Injectables”) in /procedures or procedure_detail.html, guiding users to treatment focuses.
Procedure: List within each category on detail pages (e.g., “Open Rhinoplasty” under Rhinoplasty) in procedure_detail.html, with AI recommendations below.
Tags: Render as clickable badges or filters (e.g., “Surgical,” “Non-Surgical”) on procedure_detail.html, enabling quick filtering.
Update procedure_detail.html and /procedures route/template to reflect this hierarchy, avoiding new files and building on existing procedure_detail.html.
Provide Output:
Share updated models.py, test_report.md, ai_implementation_report.md, ai_recommendations.py, add_procedures_small.py, routes.py, procedure_detail.html, base.html (if modified), logs, console output, and screenshots showing the hierarchy visualization (navigation tabs, category sub-sections, procedure listings, tags, and recommendations) for 16 and 116 procedures.
