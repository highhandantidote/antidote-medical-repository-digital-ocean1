Finalize AI Recommendations and Transition to Community Analytics:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Verify `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md` include all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics (page load times, API response times) for the 117 procedures.
   - Ensure logs (e.g., `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`) contain relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Confirm screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community.

2. Verify and Complete Data Population:
   - Confirm the 117 procedures match the RealSelf hierarchy (e.g., Open Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face, category_id for Rhinoplasty, tags=["Surgical"]). Adjust any mismatches using your SQL updates if needed.
   - Validate the dataset with a query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; and spot-check a few (e.g., IDs 1, 13, 50) with SELECT id, procedure_name, body_part, category_id, ARRAY_TO_STRING(tags, ',') as tags, min_cost, max_cost FROM procedures WHERE id IN (1, 13, 50).

3. Optimize and Verify AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Confirm `ai_recommendations.py` handles 117 procedures efficiently with weighted features and `joblib` caching.
   - Run `test_recommendation_endpoint.py` or `test_ai_simple.py` to test specific procedures (e.g., ID 1: Open Rhinoplasty, ID 13: Breast Augmentation), logging recommendation accuracy and load times.
   - Verify `routes.py` (`/procedure_detail`) and API endpoints (e.g., `/api/procedures/1/recommendations`) return expected results.

4. Verify and Finalize Category Visualization and UI:
   - Review the “Recommended For You” section in `procedure_detail.html`:
     - Confirm navigation tabs or sidebar (e.g., “Face,” “Breast”) in `base.html` or `/procedures` are prominent.
     - Verify `category` as sub-sections or dropdowns (e.g., “Breast Augmentation”).
     - Check `procedure_name` (e.g., “Breast Augmentation Standard”) is bold in cards.
     - Ensure `tags` are clickable badges (e.g., “Surgical”).
     - Validate recommendations cards:
       - Confirm 50x50px gray square placeholders are on the left.
       - Verify ratings as Font Awesome star icons (e.g., ★ 0.0) above cost.
       - Ensure three cards fit without overflow, confirming font size (14px for names, 12px for details).
       - Confirm hover effects on “Learn More” buttons work.
   - Update JavaScript to dynamically load recommendations and filter by `tags`, ensuring efficiency with 117 procedures.
   - Respond to the UI question: “Yes, the UI looks great! Please confirm font sizes (14px for names, 12px for details) and three-card fit. Also, explain how the recommendations appear in the UI (e.g., card layout, tag filtering) in `ai_implementation_report.md`.”

5. Finalize Documentation and Output:
   - Update `test_report.md` with test results for 117 procedures, including load times and timeout mitigation.
   - Enhance `ai_implementation_report.md` with details on SQL-based data expansion, weighted features, caching, UI appearance (per the UI question), and performance metrics.
   - Share updated `models.py`, `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, `ai_recommendations.py`, `add_procedures_sql.py`, `test_recommendation_endpoint.py`, `routes.py`, `procedure_detail.html`, `base.html` (if modified), logs, console output, and screenshots showing the finalized “Recommended For You” section for 117 procedures.
   - Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed and performance metrics included—please review `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md`, logs, and screenshots. Data finalized with 117 procedures using `add_procedures_sql.py`. AI tool optimized to a similarity-based model with weighted features, tested on IDs 1 and 13—please review `ai_recommendations.py` and screenshots. Category visualization and UI finalized as specified—the UI looks excellent. Data can be cleaned with `cleanup_test_data.py`. Consider real images later. Next, enhance the AI with community analytics to identify trending threads, using the 5 existing threads."
