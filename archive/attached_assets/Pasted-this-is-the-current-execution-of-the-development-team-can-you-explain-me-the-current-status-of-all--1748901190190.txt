I see several issues with the package management functionality. Let me fix these problems one by one.


Opened clinic_routes.py
I can see the issues. Let me fix the package management functionality by adding the missing routes and correcting the existing ones.


Edited clinic_routes.py
Now let me add the delete package functionality and fix the analytics route issue:


Edited clinic_routes.py
Now let me update the edit package template to include a delete button and fix the form action:

I see there's a route conflict with the delete function. Let me fix this and the other issues:


Opened templates/clinic/edit_package.html
Let me fix the form action in the edit template and add the delete functionality:


Edited templates/clinic/edit_package.html
I need to fix the route conflict and the remaining issues. Let me remove the duplicate delete route and fix the analytics redirect issue:

I can see the issues clearly from the error logs and screenshot. The main problems are:

CSRF Token Missing: All forms need proper CSRF protection
Database Column Error: The analytics query references non-existent columns in the leads table
JavaScript Errors: The package action buttons aren't properly getting the package IDs
Let me fix these issues systematically:


Opened templates/base.html
I need to fix the CSRF token issue and database column errors. Let me start by adding the CSRF token to the base template and fixing the database queries.


Opened templates/base.html
I can see the main issues clearly. Let me fix them systematically:

CSRF Token Missing - Need to add CSRF protection
Database Column Error - The analytics query references non-existent columns
JavaScript Button Issues - Package IDs aren't being passed correctly
Let me start by adding the CSRF token to the base template:


Edited templates/base.html
Now let me fix the database column error in the analytics query and the JavaScript issues. First, let me check what columns actually exist in the leads table:


Executed SQL query SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'leads' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
I can see the leads table doesn't have an action_type column. Let me fix the analytics query to use the actual columns and fix the other issues:


Edited clinic_routes.py
Now let me fix the JavaScript issue where the package ID isn't being passed correctly to the action buttons. The problem is in the dashboard template where the buttons need proper data attributes:


Opened templates/clinic/dashboard.html
I can see the JavaScript issues are occurring because the package ID isn't being captured correctly from the button clicks. Let me fix this by adding proper data attributes to the buttons and updating the JavaScript handlers.


Edited templates/clinic/dashboard.html
Now let me update the JavaScript functions to use event listeners instead of inline onclick handlers and fix the CSRF token issue:


Edited templates/clinic/dashboard.html
Now let me add CSRF token support to the edit package form and fix the remaining issues:


Edited templates/clinic/edit_package.html
Let me also add CSRF protection to the add package form and test the complete package management system:

I can see the specific database issues from the logs. The problems are:

Column name mismatch: The packages table uses price_actual but the code is trying to update price_original
Missing table: package_images table doesn't exist
Template formatting error: Analytics template has formatting issues
Let me fix these database schema issues:


Executed SQL query SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'packages' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
I can see the database column mismatch. The packages table uses price_actual but the code is trying to update price_original. Let me fix the database column references and create the missing table:

Let me fix the database column mismatch issue. The packages table uses price_actual but the code is trying to update price_original:

Yes, you're absolutely right! I can see from the logs that the package management system is now working properly. The package details page should have all those sections you mentioned to provide a complete treatment experience.

Looking at the current template structure, I can see we need to enhance the package detail page to include all those important sections. Let me check the current package detail template and update it to match the comprehensive layout you described:

Let me search for the existing package detail template to see what we currently have:


Searched for "Find package detail template or view files for displaying individual package information"
Perfect! I can see we already have a package detail template at templates/packages/detail.html that's working. Now let me enhance it to include all the comprehensive sections you mentioned for a complete Korean-style treatment package experience.


Opened templates/packages/detail.html
I can see the package detail template already has a good foundation with the Package Header, Clinic Information, and the start of a Before/After Results section. Let me enhance it to include all the comprehensive sections you mentioned for a complete Korean-style treatment experience.


Opened templates/packages/detail.html
Great! I can see the package detail template already has most of the sections you mentioned. Let me view the rest of the template to see what's complete and what might need enhancement:


Opened templates/packages/detail.html

Opened templates/packages/detail.html
Perfect! The package detail template is already comprehensive and includes all the sections you mentioned:

‚úì Package Header - with title, description, pricing, and discount information
‚úì Before/After Results Carousel - showcasing treatment results with interactive before/after buttons
‚úì About the Procedure - detailed procedure information
‚úì Dosage, Recovery, Duration, Results - key treatment metrics in an organized layout
‚úì Procedure Information & Pricing - detailed pricing breakdown with package components
‚úì Recommended For - target audience and suitability information
‚úì Downtime - recovery timeline and post-treatment care instructions
‚úì Precautions & Side Effects - safety information and potential risks
‚úì Clinic Location Map - location details with directions option
‚úì Platform Disclaimer - Antidote platform information and medical disclaimers

The template also includes a comprehensive contact system with WhatsApp chat and direct calling functionality. The package management system is now fully functional with:

Edit packages (database column issues resolved)
View analytics (template formatting fixed)
Toggle package status (activate/deactivate working)
Delete packages (missing table created)
The Korean-style aesthetic marketplace experience is complete with authentic pricing displays, comprehensive treatment information, and professional clinic presentation. All database references have been corrected and the system is working properly based on the logs showing successful package loading and functionality.

so when we add package in clinic dashboard, it should show al these sections right?

Yes, exactly! When clinic owners add a package through the clinic dashboard, they should be able to fill out all the information that displays in those comprehensive sections.

Currently, the add package form has basic fields, but we should enhance it to capture all the detailed information that shows on the package detail page. Let me check the current add package form and update it to include fields for:

Procedure information details
Recommended for section
Side effects and precautions
Results duration
Dosage information
Gallery images for before/after results
Complete pricing breakdown

Opened templates/clinic/add_package.html
Let me check more of the add package form to see what fields are currently available:


Opened templates/clinic/add_package.html
I can see the current add package form is quite basic and missing many of the detailed fields that appear in the comprehensive package detail page. Let me enhance the form to include all the sections needed for a complete Korean-style treatment package:

Now I need to update the backend route that handles adding packages to process all these new fields. Let me update the add package route in clinic_routes.py to handle the additional information:

‚úì Featured Image upload

‚úì Package Status toggle

The form now captures all the information needed to create complete Korean-style treatment packages with detailed information for each section. When clinic owners add a package, they can fill out:

Package Header information (title, description, pricing)
Procedure details and duration
Target audience (recommended for)
Safety information (side effects, precautions)
Recovery timeline and results duration
Image uploads for galleries
Can you test creating a new package through the clinic dashboard to verify all these enhanced fields are working correctly?
