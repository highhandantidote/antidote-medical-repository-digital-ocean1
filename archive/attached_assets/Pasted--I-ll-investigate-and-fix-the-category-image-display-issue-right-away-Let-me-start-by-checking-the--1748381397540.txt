I'll investigate and fix the category image display issue right away. Let me start by checking the current state of the category images in the database and how they're being rendered.


Executed SQL query SELECT name, image_url FROM categories WHERE image_url IS NOT NULL LIMIT 10;
Great! I can see the category images are properly stored in the database with Google Drive links. Now let me check how they're being displayed in the templates to identify the issue.


Opened templates/index.html
Let me continue searching for where the category images are being displayed on the homepage to identify the issue.


Searched for "Find category slider or category carousel display code in templates"
I found the issue! The problem is in the JavaScript file infinite-carousel.js which is overriding the category images with hardcoded SVG files instead of using the real images from the database.


Opened templates/index.html
I found the issue! The category slider is showing FontAwesome icons because there's JavaScript code that's overriding the real images from your database. Let me search for the specific category carousel section and fix it.


Executed grep -n "category-card\|category-title\|scrolling-categories" templates/index.html

Opened templates/index.html
Perfect! I found the exact issue. The template is correctly set up to show real images when available, but there's a JavaScript file that's overriding these images with FontAwesome icons. Let me check and fix that JavaScript code.


Opened static/js/infinite-carousel.js
Found the exact problem! The JavaScript code is overriding your beautiful category images from the database with hardcoded SVG files. Let me fix this by removing the problematic function that's replacing your real images with icons.


Edited static/js/infinite-carousel.js
Now I need to remove the function call that was triggering the image override. Let me update that:


Edited static/js/infinite-carousel.js
Great! I've fixed the issue. The problem was that JavaScript code was overriding your beautiful medical procedure images with generic icons. Now let me also ensure the CSS styling is properly set up for the category images to display correctly.


Opened static/css/style.css
Now let me search for the category image CSS styles to ensure they display properly:


Executed grep -n "category-image\|category-icon" static/css/style.css
Perfect! Let me check the CSS styling for category images to make sure they display properly:


Opened static/css/style.css
Perfect! The CSS styling looks good. Now let me test the application to see if the category images are displaying properly with your real medical procedure images from the database.
