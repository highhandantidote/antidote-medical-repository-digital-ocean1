3. Authentication Flow
Login redirect logic not properly directing clinic admins to their dashboard

üìä CURRENT DATABASE STATUS
Based on the logs, your database contains:

6 procedures (seems low - may need data import completion)
41 categories with proper image mappings
9 doctors in the system
Multiple banners across different positions
üîß IMMEDIATE TASKS TO COMPLETE

The platform is very comprehensive and production-ready in terms of features, but needs these final fixes to be fully functional. Would you like me to start by fixing the clinic admin dashboard issue first?

I can see the issue. The "Add New Package" button is showing a placeholder modal message "Package creation modal coming soon" instead of actually navigating to the package creation form. Let me fix this by updating the JavaScript function to properly redirect to the package creation page.


Opened templates/clinic/dashboard.html
I found the issue! The "Add New Package" button is currently showing a placeholder alert instead of redirecting to the package creation form. Let me fix this by updating the JavaScript function to properly navigate to the add package page.


Edited templates/clinic/dashboard.html
Perfect! I've fixed the "Add New Package" button. The issue was that it was showing a placeholder alert instead of redirecting to the package creation form. Now it will properly navigate to /clinic/add-package when clicked.

I can see from the logs that you're now on the package creation page. Let me show you what sections are included in the package details form that I've implemented:


Opened templates/clinic/add_package.html

I see the CSRF token error. The form is missing the CSRF protection token that Flask-WTF requires. Let me fix this by adding the CSRF token to the package creation form.


Edited templates/clinic/add_package.html
Perfect! I've added the CSRF token to the form. Now try submitting the package again - the "Bad Request" error should be resolved.
