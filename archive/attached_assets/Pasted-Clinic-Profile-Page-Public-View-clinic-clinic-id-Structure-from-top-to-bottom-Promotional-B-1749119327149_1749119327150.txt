Looking at your plan, I see a few potential issues that should be addressed:

Database Schema Considerations
Clinic Highlights Storage - We need a proper way to store the selected highlights (post-procedure care, CCTV, evening hours, etc.) in the database. This could be a JSON field or separate table.

Popular Procedures Ranking - Need a way to store the clinic admin's selection of top 5 procedures with their preferred order/ranking.

Promotional Banner Management - Current banner system is global. We need clinic-specific banner storage and management.

Contact Information - WhatsApp and phone numbers for CTA need dedicated fields in the clinics table.

Before/After Photo Organization - Package results photos need proper categorization to display effectively in the results gallery.

User Experience Issues
Doctor Assignment - How do clinic admins add doctors? Do they invite existing doctors or create new profiles? This affects the doctor verification workflow.

Category Selection - For specialties, should there be a limit on how many categories a clinic can select to avoid overcrowding?

Package Results - What happens if packages don't have before/after photos? Should there be a fallback or requirement?

Technical Implementation
Image Upload System - Need proper file upload handling for clinic profile images, banner images, and result photos.

Permission System - Need to ensure only clinic owners can manage their own clinic dashboard.

Data Validation - Popular procedures selection should validate that the clinic actually offers those procedures.

Should I proceed with implementing this system while addressing these considerations, or would you like to discuss any of these points first?

i want to discuss the user experience issue you highlighted. "Doctor Assignment - How do clinic admins add doctors? Do they invite existing doctors or create new profiles? This affects the doctor verification workflow."

how about clinics creating doctor profile and the main admin verifies the information. or what is the other option. suggest something

Looking at doctor assignment for clinics, I see three viable approaches:

Option 1: Clinic Creates Doctor Profiles (Recommended)
Clinic admin creates doctor profiles with complete information
Main platform admin verifies doctor credentials and medical licenses
Benefits: Single source of truth, controlled quality, proper verification
Workflow: Create → Submit for Review → Admin Verifies → Approved/Rejected
Option 2: Invitation System
Clinic admin invites existing verified doctors by email/phone
Doctors accept invitation and get associated with clinic
Benefits: Doctors maintain their own profiles, prevents duplicates
Challenge: What if doctor doesn't exist in system yet?
Option 3: Hybrid Approach
Clinic admin can either:
Search and invite existing verified doctors
Create new doctor profile (goes through verification)
Benefits: Flexibility for both scenarios
More complex to implement
My Recommendation: Option 1
This works best because:

Quality Control - Clinic provides all doctor details, admin verifies authenticity
Ownership - Clear relationship between clinic and their doctors
Verification - Platform maintains high standards through admin review
Simplicity - Straightforward workflow for clinic admins
Implementation Details:

Clinic admin fills doctor form (name, qualifications, experience, specialties)
Doctor profile created with "pending_verification" status
Platform admin reviews credentials and medical licenses
Once approved, doctor appears on clinic profile
If rejected, clinic gets feedback to correct information
Does this approach work for your platform's quality standards and workflow requirements?

yes. this approch is good

Perfect! I'll now implement the comprehensive clinic profile and dashboard management system with the doctor creation approach we discussed.

Let me start by examining the current database schema and then implement the required changes:


Executed SQL query SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'clinics' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
I'm now implementing the comprehensive clinic profile and dashboard management system. I'll start by adding the required database fields and then create the management interface.


Executed SQL query ALTER TABLE clinics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cta_whatsapp_number TEXT;

Executed SQL query ALTER TABLE clinics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cta_phone_number TEXT;
Now I'm implementing the comprehensive clinic profile system. I'll create the clinic profile page and dashboard management interface.


Edited templates/clinic/profile.html
Now I'm creating the comprehensive clinic dashboard management interface for clinic admins to manage their profiles.

I need to create the directory structure first, then continue with the implementation.

Opened templates/clinic directory
I'm creating the clinic dashboard structure and implementing the profile management system. Let me create the dashboard directory and complete the implementation.


Executed mkdir -p templates/clinic/dashboard

I can see the issue. The clinic profile page is only showing basic information and not the comprehensive sections we implemented. This is because the comprehensive clinic routes are not being used correctly. Let me investigate and fix this issue.


Executed SQL query SELECT clinic_highlights, popular_procedures, promotional_banner_url, cta_whatsapp_number, cta_phone_number, specialties FROM clinics WHERE id = 7;
I can see the data is stored correctly in the database, but the comprehensive clinic profile template is not being used. The issue is that the existing clinic routes are taking precedence over our new comprehensive routes. Let me fix this by updating the route registration order and ensuring our comprehensive clinic profile system works properly.

I can see the issue - the comprehensive clinic profile template is not being rendered correctly. The existing clinic routes are still taking precedence. Let me investigate and fix this by checking which route is actually being called and ensuring our comprehensive profile system works properly.


Executed grep -n "clinic.*/<int:clinic_id>" clinic_routes.py comprehensive_clinic_routes.py
I can see the route conflict. The comprehensive clinic route exists but isn't being used. Let me check what route is currently handling /clinic/7 and fix this issue.


Executed grep -A 10 -B 5 "def.*clinic.*profile\|route.*clinic.*int" clinic_routes.py | head -20
I found the issue. The existing clinic routes are using a different URL pattern (/profile/<slug>) and the comprehensive routes are not being properly prioritized. Let me fix this by updating the comprehensive clinic routes to handle the correct URL pattern and ensure all sections display properly.


Edited comprehensive_clinic_routes.py
I'm now updating the comprehensive clinic route to handle the correct URL pattern and fixing the database query to use the proper field names.


Edited comprehensive_clinic_routes.py
I need to fix the clinic_id variable references and ensure the comprehensive clinic profile displays all required sections. Let me update the code to properly handle the clinic ID throughout the function.

I need to check the current content of the comprehensive clinic routes file and fix the clinic_id variable issues properly.


Opened comprehensive_clinic_routes.py
I need to fix the clinic_id variable issue and ensure the comprehensive clinic profile displays all sections. Let me add the missing clinic_id assignment.

I need to fix the clinic_id variable issue by adding it after the clinic result assignment. Let me make a more targeted replacement.


Edited comprehensive_clinic_routes.py
Now I'll disable the conflicting clinic routes to ensure the comprehensive clinic profile system works properly. The route conflict is preventing the comprehensive template from rendering.


Opened clinic_routes.py
I need to resolve the route conflict that's preventing the comprehensive clinic profile from displaying. Let me temporarily disable the conflicting clinic profile route in clinic_routes.py.


Opened clinic_routes.py
I need to disable the conflicting clinic profile route to allow the comprehensive clinic profile system to work properly. Let me find and comment out the conflicting route.


Executed grep -n "@clinic_bp.route('/profile/" clinic_routes.py
I need to disable the conflicting clinic profile route to allow the comprehensive clinic profile system to work properly.
