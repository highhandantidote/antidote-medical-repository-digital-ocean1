Golden Ratio Analysis:

Implement mathematical measurements of facial proportions based on the golden ratio (1:1.618)
Show visual overlay guides highlighting how specific facial measurements compare to ideal proportions
Provide a numerical score or percentage of how closely different facial features align with these ratios
Honest Facial Assessment:

Provide more detailed and specific descriptions of facial features without sugar-coating
Include clear explanations of facial asymmetries, disproportions, or structural characteristics
Balance honesty with constructive language about potential improvements
Geometric Facial Mapping:

Create a more detailed facial map showing key measurement points and angles
Include specific measurements between facial landmarks (eye width to intercanthal distance, etc.)
Compare these measurements to established aesthetic ideals in medical literature
Facial Thirds/Fifths Analysis:

Add detailed vertical and horizontal proportion analysis using classical facial division methods
Evaluate if the face properly divides into equal thirds vertically and fifths horizontally
Highlight where proportions deviate from classical ideals
Neoclassical Canons Assessment:

Incorporate the established neoclassical canons of facial beauty
Measure specific ratios like eye separation equal to eye width
Show how the user's face compares to these established standards
Ogee Curve Evaluation:

Analyze the presence and quality of the "Ogee curve" (S-shaped curve from cheek to jaw)
Show how prominent this aesthetically desirable feature is in the user's face
Provide recommendations for enhancing this feature if underdeveloped
Profile Assessment:

Add specific analysis of the facial profile view
Measure angles like nasofrontal, nasolabial, and mentolabial angles
Compare to established aesthetic ideals for these measurements
Facial Harmony Score:

Create a numerical scoring system based on multiple facial measurements
Show which features are most harmonious and which could be improved
Provide an overall facial harmony percentage based on objective measurements
