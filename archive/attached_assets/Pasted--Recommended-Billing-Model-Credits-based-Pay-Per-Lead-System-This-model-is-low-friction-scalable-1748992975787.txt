 Recommended Billing Model: Credits-based Pay-Per-Lead System
✅ This model is low-friction, scalable, and measurable.

How It Works:
Top-Up System
Clinics purchase credits in advance. Example:

₹1000 = 1000 credits

“Top up ₹5000, get 10,000 credits” offer can be used as a promotion

Lead Costing

Chat Lead = e.g., 300 credits

Call Lead = e.g., 500 credits

Lead price may vary by specialty or city

Refund Mechanism

Clinics can request credit refund for:

Invalid leads

Duplicates

Not reachable

Antidote team approves → auto credit restoration

Transparent Ledger

Dashboard shows all charges, refunds, and top-ups with dates and notes

Billing Model: Prepaid Credit System
🪙 How It Works (System Overview)
Top-Up Wallet:

Clinics can top up credits in INR (1 credit = ₹1) via Razorpay/Stripe/etc.

Bonus credits offered on high-value top-ups

Credits reflect instantly on dashboard

Lead Deduction Logic:

Each chat or call lead from a package deducts credits based on tiered pricing:

Package Price Range	Lead Cost (in credits)
< ₹5,000	100
₹5,000 – ₹10,000	180
₹10,000 – ₹20,000	250
₹20,000 – ₹50,000	320
₹50,000 – ₹100,000	400
₹100,000+	500

Refunds/Dispute Handling:

If lead is:

Duplicate

Invalid (spam, disconnected)

Mistakenly charged

Clinic can “Dispute Lead” in dashboard

Admin reviews → if valid → credits are refunded instantly

Credit Balance Display:

Always visible in clinic dashboard header

Shows:

Current Balance

Total Used This Month

Refunds Granted

Expiring Credits (if you add expiry later)

Top-Up Promotions (Optional):

💸 ₹5,000 → Get 10,000 credits (limited time)

🎯 ₹10,000 → Get 20% bonus + featured placement

🔁 Referral Bonus: Refer a clinic → both get ₹500 credits
