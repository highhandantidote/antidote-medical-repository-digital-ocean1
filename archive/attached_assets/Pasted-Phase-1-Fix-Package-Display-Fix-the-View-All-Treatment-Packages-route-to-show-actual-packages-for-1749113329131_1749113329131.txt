Database Schema Mismatches
Clinic routes query for is_verified and overall_rating fields that don't exist in the current schema
Should use is_approved and rating instead
Package relationships may not be properly linked
Authentication & Authorization Gaps
No ownership verification - any user could potentially access any clinic's admin functions
Missing role-based access controls for clinic-specific operations
No check if current user owns the clinic being viewed
Navigation & User Experience
Banner container JavaScript errors (non-critical but affects UX)
Missing breadcrumb navigation between clinic profile and packages
No clear path back to clinic dashboard from profile page
Data Consistency Issues
Package count shows "115 detailed packages available" (hardcoded) instead of actual count
Specialties appear to be static placeholder data
Missing integration between packages created in dashboard and profile display
Missing Core Functionality
No package filtering/search on clinic profile
No doctor profiles linked to clinic
Missing contact action buttons (WhatsApp/Call) for lead generation
No integration with the credit billing system for lead tracking
SEO & Performance
Missing clinic slug-based URLs
No meta descriptions or proper page titles
Static content not optimized for search engines
