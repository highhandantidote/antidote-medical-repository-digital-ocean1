Verify Fixes, Test All Pages, and Prepare for Feature Improvements:

1. Verify Recent Fixes:
   - **Community Page (`/community`)**:
     - Confirm 6 threads display correctly after updating `routes.py` to use the `Thread` model.
     - Verify the “Create Thread” button (at the top and bottom) redirects to `/community/new`.
     - Test: Body part filter (5 threads for “Face,” 1 for “Breast”), search for “cost” (2 threads), filter lag <100ms with timestamp logs.
     - Log results in `test_report.md`.
   - **Admin Dashboard (`/dashboard/community`)**:
     - Confirm the “unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'” error is resolved after adding defensive coding.
     - Test: Metrics (e.g., Total Discussions: 6, avg_engagement handles zero replies), load time <2s.
     - Log fix confirmation in `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`.
   - **Admin Procedures (`/dashboard/procedures`)**:
     - Confirm the new route lists 5 procedures (Rhinoplasty, Facelift, Botox, Eyelid Surgery, Breast Augmentation).
     - Test editing: Update Rhinoplasty description to “Nose reshaping surgery for aesthetic improvement,” confirm it saves with: SELECT description FROM procedures WHERE id = 1;.
     - Log results in `test_report.md`.

2. Test All Pages with Current Dataset (5 Procedures, 6 Threads, No Doctors):
   - **Main Page (`/`)**:
     - Confirm doctor section shows “No doctors available,” procedures section shows 5, threads section shows 6.
     - Test search/filter functionality (expect limited results), load time <2s.
   - **Body Parts (`/body-parts`)**:
     - Confirm Face, Breast, Body display; Face: 4 procedures, Breast: 1, Body: 0; load time <2s.
   - **Categories (`/categories`)**:
     - Confirm categories (e.g., Facial Procedures, Breast Augmentation) list 5 procedures, “Popularity: None,” load time <2s.
   - **Procedures (`/procedures`)**:
     - Verify 5 procedures, search bar works (e.g., search “Rhinoplasty”), load time <2s.
   - **Doctors (`/doctors`)**:
     - Confirm “No doctors available,” filters (specialty, location) exist but are non-functional, load time <2s.
   - **Community (`/community`)**:
     - Confirm 6 threads, test filters and search (as above), load time <2s.
   - **New Thread (`/community/new`)**:
     - Verify procedure dropdown shows 5 procedures, submit a test thread (“Testing thread creation” for Rhinoplasty, keywords: “test, cost”), confirm it saves with: SELECT id, title, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads WHERE title = 'Testing thread creation';.
     - Check analytics: Thread count (7), “cost” in 3 threads with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; curl -s "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/community/trends" | python -m json.tool.
   - **Admin Pages**:
     - **Community Analytics (`/dashboard/community`)**: Confirm charts (e.g., “cost” with 2 mentions, Face: 5, Breast: 1), metrics (Total Discussions: 6), load time <2s.
     - **Doctor Verification (`/dashboard/doctor/verify`)**: Confirm “No doctors available,” load time <2s.
     - **Admin Procedures (`/dashboard/procedures`)**: Confirm functionality as above, load time <2s.

3. Populate Data Across All Pages:
   - **Seed Doctors**:
     - Create `seed_doctors.py` to seed 50 doctors: `id`, `name` (e.g., “Dr. Priya Sharma”), `specialty` (20 Plastic Surgery, 15 Dermatology, 15 Reconstructive Surgery), `qualifications` (e.g., “MBBS, MS”), `verified` (30 True, 20 False), `created_at`.
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM doctors; SELECT id, name, specialty, verified FROM doctors LIMIT 5.
   - **Seed Procedures**:
     - Use `seed_procedures_batch.py` to seed 112 more procedures (total 117): ~70 Face (add Brow Lift, Cheek Implants), ~30 Breast (add Breast Lift, Breast Reduction), ~17 Body (add Tummy Tuck, Liposuction); ~70 surgical, ~47 non-surgical.
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; SELECT id, procedure_name, body_part, surgical FROM procedures WHERE id IN (1, 13, 50).
   - **Seed Threads**:
     - Use `seed_community_threads_batch.py` to seed 50 more threads: 30 Face, 15 Breast, 5 Body, 5 more with “cost” (total 8 with “cost”).
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; SELECT id, title, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads LIMIT 10.

4. Retest All Pages After Populating:
   - **User-Facing Pages**:
     - **Main Page (`/`)**: Confirm doctor section shows 50 doctors, procedures section shows 117, threads show 56, search/filter works, load time <2s.
     - **Body Parts (`/body-parts`)**: Show counts (e.g., Face: 70, Breast: 30, Body: 17), load time <2s.
     - **Categories (`/categories`)**: Show updated popularity (e.g., Facial Procedures: High if >20 threads), load time <2s.
     - **Procedures (`/procedures`)**: Verify 117 procedures, search/filter works, load time <2s.
     - **Doctors (`/doctors`)**: Confirm 50 doctors, filters work, load time <2s.
     - **Community (`/community`)**: Verify 56 threads, filters work, search for “cost” returns 8 threads, load time <2s.
     - **New Thread (`/community/new`)**: Confirm dropdown shows 117 procedures, test thread creation, verify analytics (thread count: 57, “cost” in 9 threads).
   - **Admin Pages**:
     - **Community Analytics (`/dashboard/community`)**: Confirm charts (e.g., “cost” with 8 mentions), metrics (Total Discussions: 56), load time <2s.
     - **Doctor Verification (`/dashboard/doctor/verify`)**: Verify 50 doctors, test approve/reject, load time <2s.
     - **Admin Procedures (`/dashboard/procedures`)**: Confirm 117 procedures, test editing, load time <2s.
