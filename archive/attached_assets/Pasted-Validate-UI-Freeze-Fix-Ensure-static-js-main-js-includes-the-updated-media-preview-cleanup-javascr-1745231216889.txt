Validate UI Freeze Fix:
Ensure static/js/main.js includes the updated media preview cleanup:
javascript

Copy
document.querySelector('.media-preview .close').addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.querySelector('.media-preview').style.display = 'none';
    document.body.style.overflow = 'auto'; // Restore scrolling
});
Test /community/thread/3:
Open the Media Preview modal.
Close it and confirm scrolling and interactivity work.
Take a screenshot of the thread with the modal closed and no freeze.
Validate Community Dashboard:
Navigate to /dashboard/community:
Confirm thread #3 ("My Rhinoplasty Journey: 6 Months Update") is listed with its 5 replies and 366 views.
Click "View" on thread #3 and verify the 5-level nesting and media (sample.jpg) display.
Take a screenshot of the dashboard and the thread view.
Test Reply Submission:
Ensure community_thread_detail.html includes the reply form:
html

Copy
<form class="reply-form" data-thread-id="{{ thread.id }}">
    <textarea name="content" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit Reply</button>
</form>
Submit a test reply on /community/thread/3 and confirm it appears (check logs for POST /api/community/3/replies).
Take a screenshot of the new reply.
Validate Analytics Dashboard:
Navigate to /dashboard/community#analytics:
Confirm the placeholder charts and popular categories data are displayed.
Note if chart implementation is planned (optional for now).
Take a screenshot.
Comprehensive Testing:
Restart the application.
Test:
/community/thread/3 for nesting, media, and reply submission.
/dashboard/doctor/1 for the rating fix (if applicable).
/dashboard/community and /dashboard/community#analytics for dashboard functionality.
API endpoints (/api/community, /api/community-replies/3, /api/media/static/media/sample.jpg) with curl and log results.
Update and save: static/js/main.js, community_thread_detail.html, and any modified files.
Generate detailed logs.
Provide Output:
Share updated files, logs, and screenshots (thread #3 with media and no freeze, community dashboard, analytics dashboard, new reply).
Respond to Replitâ€™s question: "Yes, the community dashboard at /dashboard/community displays correctly with all threads, including thread #3, functioning as expected with 5-level nesting and media. The UI freeze is resolved, and everything works smoothly."
