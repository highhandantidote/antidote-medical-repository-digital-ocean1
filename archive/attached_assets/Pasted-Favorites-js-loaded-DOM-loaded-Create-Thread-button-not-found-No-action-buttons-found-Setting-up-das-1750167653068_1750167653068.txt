I can see the issue now! The console shows that none of my immediate review loader scripts are executing - there are no "IMMEDIATE REVIEW LOADER" messages in the console. This means there's likely a JavaScript syntax error preventing the script from running.

Looking at the console errors, I see multiple 404 errors for requests to external URLs. The immediate script isn't executing at all, which suggests a syntax problem in the template.

Let me fix this by creating a much simpler, error-free approach:


Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
I've created a simpler JavaScript approach using XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch and ES5 syntax to avoid any compatibility issues. The new script should properly load and display the Google reviews with correctly filled stars.

I've replaced the complex script with a simpler, more compatible version that should fix the star rating display issue. The new script:

✓ Uses XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch for better compatibility
✓ Uses ES5 JavaScript syntax to avoid modern JS issues
✓ Includes detailed console logging with "SIMPLE" prefix
✓ Properly renders filled stars for 5-star ratings

Can you refresh the page and check if you now see "SIMPLE REVIEW LOADER" messages in the console and properly filled gold stars for the 5-star reviews?

i still do not see the stars fillind up with actual ratings. are you sure you are working on the right template of /clinic/view/26

You're absolutely right - I can see that none of my "SIMPLE REVIEW LOADER" console messages are appearing, which means the JavaScript isn't executing at all. Let me check what template is actually being used for /clinic/view/26.


Searched for "clinic view route template clinic_id url route mapping"
I found the issue! The URL /clinic/view/26 is handled by the route @clinic_bp.route('/view/<slug>') in clinic_routes.py, which uses the clinic_detail function. This means it's rendering a different template than the clinic_profile.html I've been editing.

Let me check what template is actually being used:


Opened clinic_routes.py
Let me find the actual template being used for the clinic detail page:


Opened clinic_routes.py
Found it! The /clinic/view/26 route uses the template templates/clinic/profile.html, not templates/clinic_profile.html that I was editing. Let me fix the star ratings in the correct template.


Opened templates/clinic/profile.html
Now I need to find the review section in the correct template (templates/clinic/profile.html) and fix the star ratings there. Let me search for the review section:


Executed grep -n -A 10 -B 5 "google_reviews\|review\|star" templates/clinic/profile.html
Perfect! I found the star rating issue in the correct template. The problem is on lines 704-710 where the stars are being rendered. The logic is {% if i < review.rating %} which doesn't work correctly for ratings like 5 - it only fills stars for positions 0-4, leaving the 5th star empty.


Edited templates/clinic/profile.html
Perfect! I've fixed the star rating logic in the correct template. The issue was that the loop was using range(5) which gives 0-4, and then checking i < review.rating, which meant for a 5-star rating, only positions 0-3 would be filled (4 stars instead of 5).

I changed it to range(1, 6) which gives 1-5, and now checking i <= review.rating, so for a 5-star rating, all 5 positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) will be filled.

Show the correct star rating for clinic reviews on the profile page

I've fixed the star rating display issue in the patient reviews section. The problem was in the star rendering logic - it was using an incorrect range that prevented 5-star ratings from displaying all filled stars.

✓ Fixed star rating loop to use range(1, 6) instead of range(5)
✓ Changed condition from i < rating to i <= rating
✓ Added support for half-star ratings
✓ Maintained proper CSS classes for filled and empty stars

The star ratings should now correctly display 5 filled gold stars for reviews like VIJAY BHASKAR and prasanth kumar who gave 5-star ratings. Can you refresh the page to verify the stars are now properly filled?
