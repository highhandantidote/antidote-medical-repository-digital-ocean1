Below is a carefully crafted prompt designed to guide the development of the GlowUp Community platform using Replit’s AI Agent (or a similar AI-assisted development tool). The prompt focuses exclusively on building the community component, replicating X.com’s UI/UX and features, integrating the Reddit API for authentic cosmetic surgery posts, and incorporating an AI-powered doctor persona (Dr. Glow) to address user pain points (fear of outcomes, safety concerns, trust, cost uncertainty, lack of support, privacy, misinformation). The goal is to create an engaging, supportive community that motivates users to book consultations, with a marketplace integration for direct slot booking (no payment). The prompt is concise, actionable, and tailored for Replit’s AI to generate code, configurations, or a development plan.
Prompt for Replit AI Agent: GlowUp Community
Objective: Build GlowUp Community, a social platform for cosmetic surgery enthusiasts, replicating X.com’s UI/UX and community features. The platform fosters a supportive environment to address user pain points: fear of outcomes, safety concerns, trust in providers, cost uncertainty, lack of peer support, privacy issues, and misinformation. Integrate the Reddit API to fetch posts from r/PlasticSurgery, support multimedia (text, images, videos, GIFs), and feature an AI-powered doctor persona, Dr. Glow, responding to every post with empathetic, professional, and motivational replies to encourage consultation bookings. Include a direct booking system (no payment) to connect users with verified surgeons.

Notes for Using the Prompt
Replit AI Agent: Paste this into Replit’s AI Agent interface to guide development. Request specific components (e.g., “Start with feed and sidebar”) if iterative coding is supported.
Customization: Adjust if Replit’s AI has limitations (e.g., use a simpler LLM if Grok 3 is unavailable, or skip AWS Rekognition).
Testing: Use Replit’s preview to test X.com-like UI, Reddit API, and Dr. Glow responses.
Scaling: Export to Vercel/AWS for production if Replit’s environment is limited.
This prompt ensures a focused community platform that mirrors X.com, addresses cosmetic surgery pain points, and drives engagement and bookings. Let me know if you need to refine the prompt, generate sample code, or troubleshoot Replit’s AI Agent!
