In my Flask app Antidote, the login for testuser@antidote.com with password Test@1234 failed at /login. Fix the issue and complete the end-to-end testing of the Rhinoplasty Procedure Detail Page (/procedure/2):
1. Verify the password hashing mechanism:
   - Open the login route in routes.py (e.g., grep -n "login" routes.py) and check the authentication logic.
   - Confirm the use of Flask-Bcrypt or similar (e.g., user.check_password(password)).
2. Regenerate the correct password hash for 'Test@1234':
   - If using Flask-Bcrypt, run a Python shell with the app context:
     from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
     bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)  # Ensure app is available
     password_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash('Test@1234').decode('utf-8')
     print(password_hash)
   - Update the test user's password:
     EXECUTED SQL query UPDATE users SET password_hash = '<generated_hash>' WHERE email = 'testuser@antidote.com' RETURNING id, email;
     Replace <generated_hash> with the output from the shell.
3. Restart the application:
   Restarted Start application
4. Log in as testuser@antidote.com (password: Test@1234) at http://localhost:5000/login:
   - Confirm "Test User" appears in the navigation bar.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/procedure/2 (Rhinoplasty).
6. Verify the page details:
   - Confirm the procedure name is "Rhinoplasty."
   - Confirm Dr. John Smith (ID 3) is listed under "Doctors Who Perform This Procedure."
7. Test the review submission:
   - Click "Write a Review" on the Reviews tab and confirm the modal appears.
   - Enter rating 4 (select 4 stars) and comment "Great experience."
   - Submit the review and verify it appears in the Reviews tab with the correct rating and comment.
8. Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for errors during the process.
9. Check the Network tab (F12 > Network) for a POST request to /submit-review, confirming a 200 response.
10. Verify server logs:
    tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log
11. Verify the database for the submitted review:
    SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'testuser@antidote.com') AND procedure_id = 2 LIMIT 5;
    - Expect: A review with rating=4, comment="Great experience", user_id=1, procedure_id=2.
12. Provide a screenshot of /procedure/2 showing:
    - The doctors list with Dr. John Smith.
    - The review form modal (after clicking "Write a Review").
    - The submitted review in the Reviews tab.
13. Share observations for each step, including:
    - Login success and "Test User" visibility.
    - Procedure name and doctors list content.
    - Review modal appearance, submission success, and review display.
    - Any errors in the console, network, or server logs.
14. Update models.py, routes.py, templates, or the database if any issues arise.
