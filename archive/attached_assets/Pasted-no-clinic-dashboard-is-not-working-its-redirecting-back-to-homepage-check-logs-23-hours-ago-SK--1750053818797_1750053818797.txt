I need to check the logs to see why the clinic dashboard is redirecting to the homepage instead of loading properly. Let me examine the routing and see what's happening.


Executed curl -I http://localhost:5000/clinic/dashboard
I see the issue - the clinic dashboard is redirecting to login, which means the user isn't properly authenticated or the route isn't recognizing the login session. Let me check what's happening with the authentication and fix the routing.

I need to check where the unified clinic dashboard registration function is and ensure it's properly configured. Let me find the registration function and fix the routing issue.


Opened unified_clinic_dashboard.py
I see the unified clinic dashboard is registered but the authentication is not working properly. Let me check if there's a clinic profile associated with the test user and fix the authentication issue.


Executed SQL query SELECT c.*, u.name as owner_name FROM clinics c JOIN users u ON c.owner_user_id = u.id WHERE u.email = 'clinic.test@example.com';
Perfect! I can see the clinic profile exists for the test user (ID 354). The issue is that the unified clinic dashboard route is requiring login but the session isn't being recognized properly. Let me check the current login status and fix the authentication issue.


Executed SQL query SELECT id, email, role, last_login_at FROM users WHERE email = 'clinic.test@example.com';
The clinic user exists and has the correct role, but the unified clinic dashboard route is not being recognized properly. I need to check if the route is actually registered and fix the routing issue.


Executed grep -n "unified_clinic" routes.py
I can see the unified clinic routes are being registered, but there's an issue with the blueprint registration. Let me check if the blueprint is being properly imported and registered in the main app.


Opened routes.py
I need to check if the unified clinic dashboard blueprint is properly imported and registered. The issue appears to be that the route registration is failing silently.


Opened unified_clinic_dashboard.py
I need to check the main app registration to ensure the unified clinic dashboard blueprint is being registered properly. Let me examine the blueprint registration and fix the routing issue.


Opened main.py
I need to check the app.py file to see how the blueprints are being registered and fix the routing issue.


Opened app.py
Let me check the app.py file to see where the blueprint registration is happening and fix the routing issue.


Opened app.py
I can see the issue now. The unified clinic dashboard blueprint is being registered in routes.py but there's a problem with the registration process. Let me check if the blueprint is actually being imported and registered correctly.


Executed curl -v http://localhost:5000/clinic/dashboard -H "Cookie: session=test"
The authentication issue is that the unified clinic dashboard route is redirecting to login instead of recognizing the logged-in session. I need to fix the blueprint registration and ensure it's properly integrated.


Opened unified_clinic_dashboard.py
The issue is that the unified clinic dashboard blueprint isn't being properly registered with the Flask app. I need to directly register it in the main app configuration.


Edited app.py

Now I'll restart the server to apply the blueprint registration changes and test the clinic dashboard routing.
