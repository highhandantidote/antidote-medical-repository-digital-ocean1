Finalize Community Analytics Dashboard, Test Functionality, and Plan User Testing:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Confirm `test_report.md` includes all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics for 117 procedures and 5 threads.
   - Ensure `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log` contains relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Verify screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community/analytics.

2. Verify Data Population:
   - Confirm the 117 procedures match the RealSelf hierarchy (e.g., Open Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face) with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; and spot-check IDs 1, 13, 50.
   - Validate the 5 sample threads with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; and spot-check with: SELECT id, title, content, created_at, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads LIMIT 5.
   - Verify trending topics by checking keyword frequency (e.g., “Rhinoplasty,” “cost,” “recovery”) in thread `keywords`.

3. Verify and Finalize AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Confirm `ai_recommendations.py` handles 117 procedures efficiently with weighted features and caching.
   - Verify `test_recommendation_endpoint.py` results for IDs 1 and 13, ensuring accuracy and load times.
   - Confirm `routes.py` (`/procedure_detail`) and API endpoints return expected results.

4. Verify and Finalize Community Analytics Dashboard:
   - Review the `/community/analytics` dashboard in `community.html`:
     - Confirm the “Top Trends” bar chart has improved spacing, clear labels, and tooltips, with accurate top 3 trending topics (e.g., “Rhinoplasty: 15”).
     - Verify the body part distribution pie chart has a visible legend with counts (e.g., Face: 3) and interactive tooltips.
     - Ensure the body part filter dropdown filters threads dynamically.
     - Confirm the “Start Discussion” floating button redirects to `/community/new` and the form is accessible.
     - Validate the layout is clean, with optimized spacing.
   - Respond to the dashboard question: “The dashboard UI looks amazing! The enhanced chart labels and legends are clear, and the body part pie chart counts are visible. I clicked the ‘Start Discussion’ button, and it redirected to the form—great job! Please ensure the thread creation form submits data to the `Thread` model (test with a sample submission) and confirm the real-time polling updates the trending topics every 5 minutes.”
   - Update `static/js/community-analytics.js` to log polling success/failure and ensure efficient updates.

5. Test Functionality and Plan User Testing:
   - **Functionality Test**: Submit a sample thread via `/community/new` (e.g., title: “Test Thread,” content: “Test content,” procedure_id: 1) and verify it’s added to the `threads` table with: SELECT * FROM threads WHERE title = 'Test Thread';. Check `/api/community/trends` response via curl (e.g., curl -s "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/community/trends" | python -m json.tool) after 5 minutes to confirm updates.
   - **User Testing Plan**: Test with 5 users creating threads and filtering by body part, tracking success rate, load times, and user feedback on UI/UX. Plan to iterate based on results.
   - Update `test_report.md` with test results.

6. Finalize Documentation and Output:
   - Update `test_report.md` with functionality test results and user testing plan.
   - Enhance `ai_implementation_report.md` with UI details, community analytics implementation, real-time updates, and thread creation details.
   - Share updated `models.py`, `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, `ai_recommendations.py`, `add_procedures_sql.py`, `test_recommendation_endpoint.py`, `routes.py`, `procedure_detail.html`, `base.html` (if modified), `community.html`, `new_thread.html`, `community_thread_routes.py`, `seed_community_analytics.py`, `static/js/community-analytics.js`, `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`, console output, and screenshots showing the `/community/analytics` dashboard and `/community/new` form submission.
   - Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed—please review `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, logs, and screenshots. Data finalized with 117 procedures and 5 threads. AI tool optimized and tested on IDs 1 and 13. Community analytics dashboard finalized, with real-time updates and thread creation tested—please review `community.html`, `new_thread.html`, and screenshots. Next, conduct user testing as planned.”
