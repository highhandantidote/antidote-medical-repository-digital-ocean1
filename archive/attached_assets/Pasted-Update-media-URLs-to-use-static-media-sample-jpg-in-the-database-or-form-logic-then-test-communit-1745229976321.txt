Update media URLs to use /static/media/sample.jpg in the database or form logic, then test /community/thread/3 with a reply containing the image.
Fix Media URL Configuration:
Update the application to use local media (e.g., static/media/sample.jpg) instead of external URLs. Check where media URLs are set (e.g., in the database or thread/reply models) and replace with relative paths like /static/media/sample.jpg.
Example adjustment in community_replies model or form submission logic:
python

Copy
# In models.py or routes.py
reply.media_url = '/static/media/sample.jpg'  # Replace external URL
Re-test serve_media by accessing /api/media/static/media/sample.jpg with curl and log the result.
Validate Nested Replies and Media in UI:
Ensure community_thread_detail and reply_template.html are correctly implemented (as per previous code).
Navigate to /community/thread/3 in the browser:
Confirm 5 levels of nested replies are visible.
Add a test reply with sample.jpg (upload or set via code) and verify it displays.
Take a screenshot showing the nested structure and media.
Test Reply Submission:
Ensure static/js/main.js and community_thread_detail.html include the provided code (already edited, but confirm):
javascript

Copy
function createReply(threadId, content) {
    fetch(`/api/community/${threadId}/replies`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ content: content, is_anonymous: false })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) location.reload();
        else alert(data.message);
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    document.querySelectorAll('.reply-form').forEach(form => {
        form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            const threadId = form.dataset.threadId;
            const content = form.querySelector('textarea').value;
            createReply(threadId, content);
        });
    });
});
html

Copy
<form class="reply-form" data-thread-id="{{ thread.id }}">
    <textarea name="content" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit Reply</button>
</form>
Submit a test reply on /community/thread/3 and confirm it appears (check logs for POST activity).
Take a screenshot of the submitted reply.
Validate Dashboards:
Test /dashboard/community and /dashboard/doctor/1 in the browser.
Confirm the community dashboard lists threads (e.g., thread 3) and the doctor dashboard shows the rating fix.
Take screenshots of both.
Comprehensive Testing:
Restart the application.
Test:
/community/thread/3 for nested replies, media, and reply submission.
/dashboard/doctor/1 for the rating fix.
/dashboard/community for thread listing.
API endpoints (/api/community, /api/community-replies/3, /api/media/static/media/sample.jpg) with curl and log results.
Update and save: routes.py, community_reply_routes.py (if modified), community_thread_detail.html, reply_template.html, dashboard_community.html, static/js/main.js.
Generate detailed logs (e.g., media serving, reply submission, dashboard access).
Provide Output:
Share updated files, logs, and screenshots (community thread with 5-level nesting and media, doctor dashboard, community dashboard).
Respond to FLâ€™s request: "Yes, /community/thread/3 loads correctly with 5 levels of nested replies and media (sample.jpg) now displays after fixing the URL configuration. The community dashboard at /dashboard/community also loads correctly."
