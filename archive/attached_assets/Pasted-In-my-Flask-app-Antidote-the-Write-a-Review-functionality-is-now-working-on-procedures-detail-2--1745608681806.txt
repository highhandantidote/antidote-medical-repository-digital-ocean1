In my Flask app Antidote, the "Write a Review" functionality is now working on /procedures/detail/2 and /doctors/detail/3. However, there’s a JavaScript error in the console: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')". Let’s fix this and complete the review functionality testing:

1. Identify the source of the JavaScript error:
   - Open static/js/reviews.js and check for DOM manipulations without null checks, e.g.:
     const element = document.querySelector('#someElement');
     element.classList.add('active'); // Add null check
   - Update to:
     const element = document.querySelector('#someElement');
     if (element) element.classList.add('active');
   - Check for star rating or form-related manipulations that might fail if elements are missing.
   - Save the file.
   - Open templates/procedure_detail.html and check the inline script (e.g., loadRecommendations):
     const recommendationsContainer = document.querySelector('#ai-recommendations .recommendations-content');
     const loadingElement = document.querySelector('#ai-recommendations .recommendations-loading');
     // Add null checks
     if (recommendationsContainer) recommendationsContainer.innerHTML = html;
     if (loadingElement) loadingElement.style.display = 'none';
   - Save the file.
   - Repeat for templates/doctors/detail.html if it has inline scripts.

2. Test /procedures/detail/2 (Rhinoplasty):
   - Log in as `testuser@antidote.com` with password "password123".
   - Navigate to /procedures/detail/2.
   - Click "Write a Review":
     - Confirm the modal appears.
     - Verify the form includes:
       - Rating stars (1-5 stars for selection).
       - Review text area (for comments).
       - Doctor selection dropdown (optional, listing doctors).
     - Submit a review (rating 4, comment "Amazing procedure!").
     - Confirm the modal closes, the page reloads, and the review appears.
   - Take a screenshot of /procedures/detail/2 post-submission.

3. Test /doctors/detail/3 (Dr. John Smith):
   - Navigate to /doctors/detail/3.
   - Click "Write a Review":
     - Confirm the modal appears.
     - Verify the form includes:
       - Rating stars (1-5 stars for selection).
       - Review text area (for comments).
       - Procedure selection dropdown (if applicable, listing procedures).
     - Submit a review (rating 4, comment "Highly recommend this doctor!").
     - Confirm the modal closes, the page reloads, and the review appears.
   - Take a screenshot of /doctors/detail/3 post-submission.

4. Verify database entries:
   - Check reviews for the procedure:
     SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE procedure_id = 2;
   - Check reviews for the doctor:
     SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE doctor_id = 3;

5. Check for errors:
   - F12 > Console and Network tabs on both /procedures/detail/2 and /doctors/detail/3 (screenshot if errors remain).
   - Run: tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log and report issues.

6. Provide a summary:
   - Confirm the JavaScript error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')" is resolved.
   - Confirm the modal appears and form elements (rating stars, text area, doctor/procedure selection) are present on both pages.
   - Confirm reviews are submitted, visible, and saved in the database.
   - Include screenshots from steps 2 and 3.
   - Note any errors from step 5.
   - Suggest next steps (e.g., link procedures to doctors, enhance search functionality).

Run this prompt and share the summary with screenshots. Let’s ensure the review functionality is fully stable!
