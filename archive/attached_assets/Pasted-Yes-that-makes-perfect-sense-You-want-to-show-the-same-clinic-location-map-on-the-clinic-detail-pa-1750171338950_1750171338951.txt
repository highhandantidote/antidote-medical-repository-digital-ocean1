Yes, that makes perfect sense! You want to show the same clinic location map on the clinic detail page (/clinic/view/26) so patients can see where the clinic is located when viewing the clinic profile. This creates consistency across the platform - whether someone is looking at a specific treatment package or the clinic's main profile, they'll see the same location information.

Let me implement this by adding the location section to the clinic detail page template.


Searched for "clinic detail page template with "What Our Patients Have to Say" section"
I found the clinic profile template. Let me add the location section after the "What Our Patients Say" section in the clinic detail page.


Opened templates/clinic_profile.html
Let me find the "What Our Patients Say" section in the clinic profile template and add the location section after it.

I need to find the "What Our Patients Say" section in the clinic profile template to add the location section after it.


Executed grep -n -A 5 -B 5 "What Our Patients" templates/clinic_profile.html
I'll add the clinic location section after the "What Our Patients Say" section. Let me find the end of that section and add the location map.

Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I need to add the Leaflet CSS and JavaScript dependencies to the clinic profile template, and include the map loading functionality. Let me add the required dependencies and scripts.

Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I'll add the map loading functionality to the clinic profile template. I need to add the map loading functions that work with the server-side geocoding endpoint.


Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I'll test the clinic location map functionality on the clinic detail page to ensure it's working properly.
