Verify Current Implementation:
Banner Display: Confirm that all 4 banners are displaying correctly on the homepage (templates/index.html):
Banner 1 (position: between_hero_stats): A slider with 3 slides (Botox, Rhinoplasty, Facelift).
Banner 2 (position: between_procedures_specialists): A single slide (Dr. Doctor Test).
Banner 3 (position: between_categories_community): A single slide (Lip Fillers, using a provided image).
Banner 4 (position: before_footer): A single slide (Hair Transplant).
Slider Functionality: For Banner 1, verify that the slider (controlled by static/js/slider.js) auto-cycles every 3 seconds with a smooth fade transition, and includes navigation dots below the banner (clickable to jump to a specific slide).
Banner Dimensions and Styling: Ensure all banners are 900x450 pixels, with a light blue-to-white gradient background (linear-gradient(to right, #e0f7fa, #b2ebf2)), rounded corners (8px), centered text with a CTA button, and navigation dots (for sliders) 10px below the banner. Check static/css/banner-slider.css for these styles.
Lip Filler Banner (Banner 3): Verify that Banner 3 uses the provided lip filler image ([PROVIDED_LIP_FILLER_IMAGE_URL]—replace with the actual URL once uploaded), with a text overlay: subtitle 'Get fuller, plumper lips with a quick and safe procedure.' and a CTA button 'Learn More' linking to /learn/lip-fillers. The title ('Experience the Transformation with Our Lip Fillers') is already on the image.
Database Data: Confirm the database matches the specified data:
Banner 1 (Slider, position: between_hero_stats): 3 slides:
Slide 1: image_url='https://via.placeholder.com/900x450', title='Smooth Away Wrinkles with Botox – See the Difference!', subtitle='Rejuvenate your skin with a quick and effective treatment.', redirect_url='/learn/botox'.
Slide 2: image_url='https://via.placeholder.com/900x450', title='Transform Your Look with Rhinoplasty – Explore Now!', subtitle='Nose reshaping surgery to enhance appearance and function.', redirect_url='/learn/rhinoplasty'.
Slide 3: image_url='https://via.placeholder.com/900x450', title='Youthful Glow with a Facelift – Learn More!', subtitle='Tighten and lift for a rejuvenated appearance.', redirect_url='/learn/facelift'.
Banner 2 (Single Image, position: between_procedures_specialists): 1 slide: image_url='https://via.placeholder.com/900x450', title='Meet Dr. Doctor Test – Mumbai’s Top Plastic Surgeon!', subtitle='Specializing in Rhinoplasty, Facelifts, and more.', redirect_url='/doctors/1'.
Banner 3 (Single Image, position: between_categories_community): 1 slide: image_url='[PROVIDED_LIP_FILLER_IMAGE_URL]', title='Experience the Transformation with Our Lip Fillers', subtitle='Get fuller, plumper lips with a quick and safe procedure.', redirect_url='/learn/lip-fillers'.
Banner 4 (Single Image, position: before_footer): 1 slide: image_url='https://via.placeholder.com/900x450', title='Restore Your Hair with a Transplant – See the Results!', subtitle='Regain a fuller head of hair with a proven procedure.', redirect_url='/learn/hair-transplant'.
All banners should have is_visible=True, no scheduling (start_date and end_date as NULL), and click_count=0.
Check for JavaScript Errors:
Open the browser console and check for any JavaScript errors related to banner-loader.js or slider.js. Common issues might include:
Failed DOM manipulation (e.g., trying to access elements that don’t exist).
Issues with the slider functionality (e.g., navigation dots not working).
Errors in handling AJAX responses.
If errors are found, update static/js/banner-loader.js and static/js/slider.js to fix them. For example, ensure that banner-loader.js correctly parses the JSON response from /api/banners/<position> and that slider.js properly initializes the slider for banners with multiple slides.
Verify Functionality:
Slider Functionality: Confirm that Banner 1’s slider auto-cycles every 3 seconds, navigation dots work, and clicking a slide redirects to the correct URL (e.g., /learn/botox).
Click Tracking: Click on each banner slide and verify that the click_count in the banner_slides table increments. This should be handled via a POST request to /api/banners/click/<slide_id> in banner_routes.py. If not implemented, add this endpoint to increment the click_count and redirect to the slide’s redirect_url.
Visibility and Scheduling: Ensure that only banners with is_visible=True and within their scheduled date range (compare with May 03, 2025) are displayed. This should be handled in the /api/banners/<position> endpoint in banner_routes.py.
Redirects: Confirm that clicking each banner slide redirects to the specified URL (e.g., /learn/lip-fillers for Banner 3).
Admin Dashboard Verification:
Access the admin dashboard (/admin/banners), log in (username: admin, password: admin123), and verify:
All 4 banners are listed with their slides (image URL, title, subtitle, redirect URL, click count).
You can add a new slide to a banner (e.g., add a fourth slide to Banner 1).
You can edit/delete existing slides (using templates/admin_edit_slide.html).
Visibility toggle (is_visible checkbox) works and updates the homepage accordingly.
Scheduling (start/end dates) works and affects banner visibility.
Preview feature shows a scaled-down version of each slide (e.g., 300x150 pixels).
Reset to default reverts the banner to its initial state.
Click count is displayed and can be reset to 0.
Ensure the dashboard has a clean, tabular layout, light theme (white background, subtle borders, readable fonts), and is mobile-responsive.
Fix Any Issues:
If the slider isn’t working, update static/js/slider.js to ensure it correctly initializes the slider for banners with multiple slides, handles auto-cycling, and manages navigation dots.
If click tracking isn’t working, implement the /api/banners/click/<slide_id> endpoint in banner_routes.py to increment the click_count and redirect to the redirect_url.
If the admin dashboard isn’t fully functional, update banner_routes.py, templates/admin_banners.html, and templates/admin_edit_slide.html to implement all required features (add/edit/delete slides, visibility toggle, scheduling, preview, reset).
Testing:
Restart the application, navigate to the homepage (/), and verify:
Banner 1 displays as a slider with 3 slides, auto-cycling every 3 seconds, with navigation dots and correct redirects.
Banner 2 displays as a single-image banner (Dr. Doctor Test) at 900x450 pixels.
Banner 3 displays the provided lip filler image at 900x450 pixels with the correct text overlay and CTA.
Banner 4 displays as a single-image banner (Hair Transplant) at 900x450 pixels.
Click each banner slide and verify the click_count increments in the database.
Access the admin dashboard (/admin/banners) and test all features (add/edit/delete slides, visibility toggle, scheduling, preview, reset).
Check the browser console to confirm there are no JavaScript errors."
