lets go stepwise.

first we shall identify missing sections in package detail page by matching it with below schema description and the image i provided in screenshot
the sections on package detail page should be as below:
package name
2,. address
price (actual price, discounted price, discount percentage). price need not to be rounded to 100 it could be anything
results (before and after images) - the card will be having 3 fields (title, doctor name, 2 media images, description(show only 2 lines and give 'show more' option. copy the slider layout as in the image
About the procedure - show 3 lines and give 'show more' option
key highlights of the procedure ( Dosage or procedure type like surgical non sugical etc. give a place for admin to enter whatever they want to highlight, recovery,duration,results)
procedure information & pricing - this field will explain all the procedures that will be done in this package. admin can enter anything in procedure information and anything in price (actual price, discounted price, discount percentage). price need not to be rounded to 100 it could be anything. there could be infinite number of procedures.
VAT, Anesthetic type, After Care Kit
recommended for - show 3 lines and give 'see more' option
Downtime : how much time, description
precautions & side effects
Address of clinic on open street map
Antidote disclaimer
14 sticky buttons on the below of - chat, call (here chat will open clinic whatsapp numer. so clinic admin should be given option to use same number as provided in clinic inforamtion or they can update new whatsapp number for a particular package.
design should match screenshot. tell what you undertood and implement only after my approval

2, in package management on clinic dashboard, the form should be modified to accomodate the changes to match our actual template sections. so whenever admin wants to add a new package, the new form should populate.

I understand the requirements for the package detail page. Let me analyze what you've described and the screenshot to ensure I have the complete picture:

Package Detail Page Sections Required:
Package Header: Name, address, pricing (actual/discounted/percentage)
Results Section: Before/after image slider with cards (title, doctor name, 2 images, description with "show more")
About the Procedure: 3 lines with "show more" option
Key Highlights: Dosage/type, recovery, duration, results (admin customizable)
Procedure Information & Pricing: Multiple procedures with individual pricing
Additional Info: VAT, Anesthetic type, After Care Kit
Recommended For: 3 lines with "see more" option
Downtime: Duration and description
Precautions & Side Effects: Full section
Clinic Location: OpenStreetMap integration
Antidote Disclaimer: Standard disclaimer
Sticky Action Buttons: Chat (WhatsApp) and Call with customizable numbers
Package Management Form Updates:
The clinic dashboard form needs fields for all these sections, allowing admins to:

Add multiple procedures with individual pricing
Upload before/after images for results
Set custom WhatsApp numbers per package
Configure all text sections with rich content
My Understanding:
Looking at the screenshot, I can see the layout has:

Blue header with package name and discount badge
Results slider with before/after cards
Structured information sections
Map integration at the bottom
Clean, medical-focused design
Questions before implementation:

Should the before/after images support video uploads as well as images?
For the procedure pricing section, do you want a table format or card-based layout?
Should the WhatsApp integration include message templates or just direct chat?
Once you confirm these details and approve my understanding, I'll implement both the package detail page template and the updated management form in the clinic dashboard.

yes
card-based layout
include message templates

I understand the issue. You want to use the enhanced package creation form in the clinic dashboard, but it's showing the old sections instead of the new comprehensive form. Let me fix this by updating the clinic dashboard to use the enhanced package form.
