Part 1: Verify Data in the Database
Instructions for Replit Agent:

Create a Script to Check Database Data:
Create a new file named check_data.py in the project root.
Add the following code to query the database and print the counts and details of all relevant models:
text

Copy
from app import app, db
from models import User, Doctor, Procedure, Category, BodyPart, Review, CommunityThread

def check_data():
    with app.app_context():
        # Check users
        users = User.query.all()
        print("Users:", len(users))
        for user in users:
            print(user.email, user.role)

        # Check doctors
        doctors = Doctor.query.all()
        print("Doctors:", len(doctors))
        for doctor in doctors:
            print(doctor.user.name if doctor.user else 'N/A', doctor.specialty)

        # Check procedures
        procedures = Procedure.query.all()
        print("Procedures:", len(procedures))
        for procedure in procedures:
            print(procedure.name, procedure.category)

        # Check categories
        categories = Category.query.all()
        print("Categories:", len(categories))
        for category in categories:
            print(category.name)

        # Check body parts
        body_parts = BodyPart.query.all()
        print("Body Parts:", len(body_parts))
        for body_part in body_parts:
            print(body_part.name)

        # Check reviews
        reviews = Review.query.all()
        print("Reviews:", len(reviews))
        for review in reviews:
            print(review.rating, review.comment)

        # Check community threads
        threads = CommunityThread.query.all()
        print("Community Threads:", len(threads))
        for thread in threads:
            print(thread.title, thread.category)
