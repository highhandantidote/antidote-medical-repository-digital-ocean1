In my Flask app Antidote, the login issue for testuser@antidote.com has been resolved, and Dr. John Smith (ID 3) is displayed on the Rhinoplasty Procedure Detail Page (/procedure/2). Complete the end-to-end testing to confirm full functionality before moving on:
1. Log in as testuser@antidote.com (password: Test@1234) at http://localhost:5000/login:
   - Confirm "Test User" appears in the navigation bar.
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/procedure/2 (Rhinoplasty).
3. Verify the page details:
   - Confirm the procedure name is "Rhinoplasty."
   - Confirm Dr. John Smith (ID 3) is listed under "Doctors Who Perform This Procedure."
4. Test the review submission:
   - Click "Write a Review" on the Reviews tab and confirm the modal appears.
   - Enter rating 4 (select 4 stars) and comment "Great experience."
   - Submit the review and verify it appears in the Reviews tab with the correct rating and comment.
5. Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for errors during the process.
6. Check the Network tab (F12 > Network) for a POST request to /submit-review, confirming a 200 response.
7. Verify server logs:
   tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log
8. Verify the database for the submitted review:
   SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'testuser@antidote.com') AND procedure_id = 2 LIMIT 5;
   - Expect: A review with rating=4, comment="Great experience", user_id=1, procedure_id=2.
9. Provide a screenshot of /procedure/2 showing:
   - The doctors list with Dr. John Smith.
   - The review form modal (after clicking "Write a Review").
   - The submitted review in the Reviews tab.
10. Share observations for each step, including:
    - Login success and "Test User" visibility.
    - Procedure name and doctors list content.
    - Review modal appearance, submission success, and review display.
    - Any errors in the console, network, or server logs.
11. Update models.py, routes.py, templates, or the database if any issues arise.
12. If all tests pass, confirm that the Procedure Detail Page functionality is fully resolved and ready to move on to the next task.
