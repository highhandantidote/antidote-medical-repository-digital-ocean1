Finalize Fixes and Test All Pages to Ensure Stability:

1. Verify Community Page Fix:
   - Confirm the `/community` page now displays 6 threads after updating `routes.py` to use the `Thread` model.
   - Test: Body part filter (5 threads for “Face,” 1 for “Breast”), search for “cost” (2 threads), filter lag <100ms with timestamp logs.
   - Log results in `test_report.md`.

2. Fix Admin Dashboard Error:
   - Debug the “unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'” error in the admin dashboard (likely `/dashboard/community` or `/dashboard/procedures`).
   - Check `routes.py` for functions (e.g., `avg_engagement`)—ensure variables are initialized (e.g., set default 0 if `None`).
   - Test: Confirm `/dashboard/community` and `/dashboard/procedures` load without errors, metrics (e.g., Total Discussions: 6) display correctly.
   - Log fix in `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`.

3. Fix UI Errors on Community Page:
   - Address “Create Thread button not found” and “No action buttons found”:
     - Verify `community.html` includes the “Create Thread” button (should link to `/community/new`, e.g., `<a href="/community/new" class="btn">Create Thread</a>`).
     - Ensure action buttons (e.g., filter toggles for body parts, categories) are present and functional.
   - Test: Confirm button redirects to `/community/new`, filters work, log results in `test_report.md`.

4. Test All Pages with Current Dataset (5 Procedures, 6 Threads, No Doctors):
   - **Main Page (`/`)**:
     - Confirm doctor section shows “No doctors available,” procedures section shows 5 (Rhinoplasty, Facelift, Botox, Eyelid Surgery, Breast Augmentation), threads section shows 6.
     - Test search/filter functionality (expect limited results), load time <2s.
   - **Body Parts (`/body-parts`)**:
     - Confirm Face, Breast, Body display; Face: 4 procedures, Breast: 1, Body: 0; load time <2s.
   - **Categories (`/categories`)**:
     - Confirm categories (e.g., Facial Procedures, Breast Augmentation) list 5 procedures, “Popularity: None,” load time <2s.
   - **Procedures (`/procedures`)**:
     - Verify 5 procedures display, search bar works (e.g., search “Rhinoplasty”), load time <2s.
   - **Doctors (`/doctors`)**:
     - Confirm “No doctors available,” filters (specialty, location) exist but are non-functional, load time <2s.
   - **Community (`/community`)**:
     - Confirm 6 threads, test filters and search (as above), load time <2s.
   - **New Thread (`/community/new`)**:
     - Verify procedure dropdown shows 5 procedures, submit a test thread (“Testing thread creation” for Rhinoplasty, keywords: “test, cost”), confirm it saves with: SELECT id, title, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads WHERE title = 'Testing thread creation';.
     - Check analytics: Thread count (7), “cost” in 3 threads with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; curl -s "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/community/trends" | python -m json.tool.
   - **Admin Pages**:
     - **Community Analytics (`/dashboard/community`)**: Confirm charts (e.g., “cost” with 2 mentions, Face: 5, Breast: 1), metrics (Total Discussions: 6), load time <2s.
     - **Doctor Verification (`/dashboard/doctor/verify`)**: Confirm “No doctors available,” load time <2s.
     - **Admin Procedures (`/dashboard/procedures`)**: Confirm 5 procedures, test editing (update Rhinoplasty description to “Nose reshaping surgery”), load time <2s.

5. Populate Data Across All Pages:
   - **Seed Doctors**:
     - Create `seed_doctors.py` to seed 50 doctors: `id`, `name` (e.g., “Dr. Priya Sharma”), `specialty` (20 Plastic Surgery, 15 Dermatology, 15 Reconstructive Surgery), `qualifications` (e.g., “MBBS, MS”), `verified` (30 True, 20 False), `created_at`.
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM doctors; SELECT id, name, specialty, verified FROM doctors LIMIT 5.
   - **Seed Procedures**:
     - Use `seed_procedures_batch.py` to seed 112 more procedures (total 117): ~70 Face (add Brow Lift, Cheek Implants), ~30 Breast (add Breast Lift, Breast Reduction), ~17 Body (add Tummy Tuck, Liposuction); ~70 surgical, ~47 non-surgical.
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; SELECT id, procedure_name, body_part, surgical FROM procedures WHERE id IN (1, 13, 50).
   - **Seed Threads**:
     - Use `seed_community_threads_batch.py` to seed 50 more threads: 30 Face, 15 Breast, 5 Body, 5 more with “cost” (total 8 with “cost”).
     - Verify with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; SELECT id, title, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads LIMIT 10.

6. Retest All Pages After Populating:
   - Repeat tests from Step 4 with updated data (50 doctors, 117 procedures, 56 threads), ensuring all pages render correctly, filters work, and load times are <2s.

7. Respond:
   - Summarize: “Fixed community rendering (6 threads now display), resolved admin dashboard error, fixed UI issues (Create Thread button now works). Tested all pages with 5 procedures, 6 threads, no doctors: [list key results]. Populated 50 doctors, 117 procedures, 56 threads, retested: [list key results]. No errors found, ready for feature improvements.”
   - Share `test_report.md`, `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`, `routes.py`, `community.html`, `doctors.html`, `procedures.html`, `body_parts.html`, `categories.html`, `community_new.html`, `index.html`, `dashboard_community.html`, `dashboard_doctor_verify.html`, `dashboard_procedures.html`, `seed_doctors.py`, `seed_procedures_batch.py`, `seed_community_threads_batch.py`, console output, and screenshots of all pages.

8. Next Steps:
   - Await confirmation to proceed with AI-driven feature improvements.
