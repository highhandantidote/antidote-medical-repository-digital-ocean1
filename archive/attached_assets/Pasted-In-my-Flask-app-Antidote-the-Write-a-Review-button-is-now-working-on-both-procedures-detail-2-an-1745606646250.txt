In my Flask app Antidote, the "Write a Review" button is now working on both /procedures/detail/2 and /doctors/detail/3 after adding {% block modals %} to base.html and improving reviews.js error handling. Let’s confirm the functionality and ensure consistency:

1. Test /procedures/detail/2 (Rhinoplasty):
   - Log in as `testuser@antidote.com` with password "password123".
   - Navigate to /procedures/detail/2.
   - Click "Write a Review":
     - Confirm the modal appears.
     - Verify the form includes:
       - Rating stars (1-5 stars for selection).
       - Review text area (for comments).
       - Doctor selection dropdown (optional, listing doctors).
     - Submit a review (rating 4, comment "Amazing procedure!").
     - Confirm the modal closes, the page reloads, and the review appears.
   - Take a screenshot of /procedures/detail/2 post-submission.

2. Test /doctors/detail/3 (Dr. John Smith):
   - Navigate to /doctors/detail/3.
   - Click "Write a Review":
     - Confirm the modal appears.
     - Verify the form includes:
       - Rating stars (1-5 stars for selection).
       - Review text area (for comments).
       - Procedure selection dropdown (if applicable, listing procedures).
     - Submit a review (rating 4, comment "Highly recommend this doctor!").
     - Confirm the modal closes, the page reloads, and the review appears.
   - Take a screenshot of /doctors/detail/3 post-submission.

3. Verify database entries:
   - Check reviews for the procedure:
     SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE procedure_id = 2;
   - Check reviews for the doctor:
     SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE doctor_id = 3;

4. Check for errors:
   - F12 > Console and Network tabs on both /procedures/detail/2 and /doctors/detail/3 (screenshot if errors remain).
   - Run: tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log and report issues.

5. Provide a summary:
   - Confirm the modal appears and the form elements (rating stars, text area, doctor/procedure selection) are present on both pages.
   - Confirm reviews are submitted, visible, and saved in the database.
   - Include screenshots from steps 1 and 2.
   - Note any errors from step 4.
   - Suggest next steps (e.g., link procedures to doctors, enhance search functionality).

Run this prompt and share the summary with screenshots. Let’s ensure everything is working smoothly!
