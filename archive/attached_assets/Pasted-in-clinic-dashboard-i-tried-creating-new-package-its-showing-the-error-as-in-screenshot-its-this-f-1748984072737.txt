I can see the error in the screenshot - "Error creating package. Please try again." The package creation form is loading, but there's an error when submitting. Looking at the console logs, I see a CSRF token missing error and some JavaScript errors. Let me fix these issues.


Opened templates/clinic/add_package_enhanced.html
I found the issue causing the "Error creating package" error. There are multiple problems:

CSRF token missing error in the logs
JavaScript errors when submitting the form
The enhanced package creation route may not be handling form submission properly
Let me fix these issues systematically.

I found the CSRF token and form submission issues. Let me fix the enhanced package creation form to properly handle form submission and CSRF tokens.


Opened templates/clinic/add_package_enhanced.html
I found the issue causing the "Error creating package" error. The JavaScript form submission is expecting JSON responses, but the enhanced package route isn't properly handling the POST request and returning JSON. Let me fix the enhanced package route to properly handle form submission.


Opened enhanced_package_routes.py
The enhanced package route looks correct but there's a database schema issue. The route is trying to use clinic.id from SQLAlchemy but we're using raw SQL with a dictionary. Let me fix this and also check if the packages table has all the required columns.


Executed SQL query SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'packages' ORDER BY ordinal_position;

The packages table schema looks correct with all the enhanced columns. The issue is that the enhanced package route is trying to use clinic.id but clinic is a dictionary from raw SQL, not a SQLAlchemy object. Let me fix this.

I need to fix the remaining errors in the enhanced package route and test the package creation functionality.

I've fixed the database column reference issues and enhanced package route errors. Can you test the "Add New Package" functionality in the clinic dashboard? Try filling out the basic package information form and clicking "Publish Package" to see if the enhanced 14-section package creation works without the "Error creating package" error.
