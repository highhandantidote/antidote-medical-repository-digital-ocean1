Dr Harini in Manya Aesthetic Clinic is a friendly and good doctor. She told me upfront about what to expect out of my scar treatment and was always happy to answer tons of my questions. The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well. The clinic has nice ambience. Overall, it's a good place to get your skin related issues sorted. Would recommend Dr Harini for sure.
