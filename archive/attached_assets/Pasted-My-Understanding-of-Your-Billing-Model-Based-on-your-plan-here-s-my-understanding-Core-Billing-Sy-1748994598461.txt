My Understanding of Your Billing Model
Based on your plan, here's my understanding:

Core Billing System
Prepaid Credits: 1 credit = ₹1, clinics top-up in advance
Dynamic Lead Pricing: Cost varies by package price range (₹100-500 credits)
Instant Deduction: Credits deducted when user clicks chat/call
Dispute System: Clinics can request refunds for invalid leads
Promotional Bonuses: Extra credits on high-value top-ups
Lead Pricing Tiers (Your Model)
< ₹5,000 packages → 100 credits per lead
₹5,000-₹10,000 → 180 credits per lead
₹10,000-₹20,000 → 250 credits per lead
₹20,000-₹50,000 → 320 credits per lead
₹50,000-₹100,000 → 400 credits per lead
₹100,000+ → 500 credits per lead

Compatibility Considerations
✅ Preserves Existing Features

Current lead generation flow remains intact

Suggested Improvements

Implementation Timeline
Week 1: Database schema + basic credit system

Does this plan align with your vision? Should I proceed with Phase 1 (database schema) first, or would you like me to modify any aspects of the implementation approach?

aare we missing anything or shall we go ahead with this plan?

I've reviewed the plan thoroughly and it looks comprehensive. However, I want to highlight a few considerations before we proceed:

Missing Elements to Consider:
Credit Balance Validation: Should we block lead generation when credits are insufficient, or allow negative balance with alerts?

Minimum Top-up Amount: What's the minimum credit purchase (e.g., ₹1000 minimum)?

Admin Credit Adjustment: Should admins be able to manually add/deduct credits for special cases?

Lead Quality Threshold: Any automatic validation to prevent spam leads (e.g., same phone number multiple times)?

Razorpay Credentials: I'll need your Razorpay API keys when we reach the payment integration phase.

Current Implementation Compatibility:
The plan preserves all existing functionality:

Package creation and display remains unchanged
Current lead generation flow gets enhanced (not replaced)
Admin dashboard gains new credit management features
Clinic dashboard gets credit widgets added
Ready to Proceed:
The implementation plan is solid and backward-compatible. Unless you want to address any of the above considerations, I'm ready to start with Phase 1 (database schema updates).

Shall I begin implementing the credit system database schema and basic credit management functionality?

The implementation will be done incrementally, so existing features continue working while we add the billing layer on top.

allow negative balance with alerts
1000 minimum
yes. admin credit adjustment is must
lets track the suspected scam leads, later we shall take a plan how to tacle this
razorpay api keys is ready
start implementation
