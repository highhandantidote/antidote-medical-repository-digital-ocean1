In my Flask app Antidote, the Procedure Detail Page for /procedure/2 shows "Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty" with 0 doctors instead of Rhinoplasty with Dr. John Smith. Fix and test:
1. Verify the procedure name:
   SELECT id, procedure_name FROM procedures WHERE id = 2;
   If incorrect, update to 'Rhinoplasty':
   UPDATE procedures SET procedure_name = 'Rhinoplasty' WHERE id = 2;
2. Verify the DoctorProcedure association:
   SELECT * FROM doctor_procedures WHERE doctor_id = 3 AND procedure_id = 2;
   If missing, insert:
   INSERT INTO doctor_procedures (doctor_id, procedure_id, created_at) VALUES (3, 2, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) RETURNING id;
3. Ensure the route in routes.py supports both paths:
   @web.route('/procedure/<int:id>')
   @web.route('/procedures/detail/<int:id>')
   def procedure_detail(id):
       procedure = Procedure.query.get_or_404(id)
       procedure_doctors = Doctor.query.join(DoctorProcedure).filter(DoctorProcedure.procedure_id == id).all()
       reviews = Review.query.filter_by(procedure_id=id).order_by(Review.created_at.desc()).all()
       return render_template('procedure_detail.html', procedure=procedure, procedure_doctors=procedure_doctors, reviews=reviews)
4. Restart the application:
   Restarted Start application
5. Log in as testuser@antidote.com (password: Test@1234) at http://localhost:5000/login, confirming "Test User" in the navigation bar.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/procedure/2 (Rhinoplasty).
7. Confirm Dr. John Smith (ID 3) is listed under "Doctors Who Perform This Procedure."
8. Click "Write a Review" on the Reviews tab, enter rating 4 and comment "Great experience," submit the review, and verify it appears.
9. Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for errors.
10. Check the Network tab (F12 > Network) for a POST request to /submit-review with a 200 response.
11. Verify server logs: tail -n 50 /tmp/replit-nix-errors.log.
12. Verify the database:
    SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'testuser@antidote.com') AND procedure_id = 2 LIMIT 5;
13. Provide a screenshot of /procedure/2 showing the doctors list, review form modal, and submitted review.
14. Update models.py, routes.py, templates, or the database if any issues arise.
