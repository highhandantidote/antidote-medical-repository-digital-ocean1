Searched for "preview profile button or link functionality in clinic dashboard"
I can see the issue. The console logs show an error: "Could not build url for endpoint 'web.category_procedures' with values ['category_id']" which indicates a routing problem. Let me search for the "preview profile" button specifically and check the clinic dashboard routing.


Searched for ""

Opened templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
I found the issue! The preview profile button is using url_for('clinic.clinic_detail', slug=clinic.id) but it's passing the clinic ID as a slug parameter instead of using the proper route structure.

Let me check the routing configuration to see how the clinic profile routes are set up:


Searched for ""

Searched for "clinic profile routing and URL patterns for viewing clinic profiles"
Looking at the routing structure, I can see the issue. The preview profile button is calling url_for('clinic.clinic_detail', slug=clinic.id) but based on the routing patterns, it should be using a different route name or structure.

Let me check the main routes file to see how the clinic profile routes are actually registered:


Opened routes.py

Searched for "clinic profile route registration and URL patterns in main application file"
I can see the issue. The preview profile button is using url_for('clinic.clinic_detail', slug=clinic.id) but the route is redirecting to /clinic/ instead of /clinic/view/26. Let me check the main app file to see how the clinic routes are registered and fix the routing issue.


Opened app.py

Now I need to check how the routes are registered to understand the routing structure. Let me look at the routes registration:

I understand the issue. The "Preview Profile" button is redirecting to /clinic/ instead of the specific clinic profile page like /clinic/view/26. Let me examine the routing and fix this.


Searched for "clinic routes blueprint registration and URL patterns for clinic profile viewing"
I need to check how the clinic routes are actually structured. Let me examine the clinic_routes.py file to understand the URL patterns:


Opened clinic_routes.py

Searched for ""
Let me check the specific route pattern for clinic profile viewing:


Opened clinic_routes.py
Perfect! I found the issue. The clinic profile route is at /view/<slug> but the preview button is using the wrong URL structure. Let me fix the preview profile button in the unified dashboard template.

I can see the route pattern is correct - /view/<slug>. The issue is that the URL is being built correctly but something is causing it to redirect to just /clinic/. Let me check if there are any redirects or route conflicts in the clinic routes.


Opened clinic_routes.py
The issue is that the clinic lookup in the clinic_detail route is failing and redirecting back to the marketplace. Looking at the console logs, I can see the error: "Could not build url for endpoint 'web.category_procedures'" which suggests there's a routing issue, and the clinic query is likely failing because the clinic might not be approved.

Let me check the clinic's approval status and fix the routing issue:


Executed SQL query SELECT id, name, is_approved, is_verified, owner_user_id FROM clinics WHERE id = 26;
Good, the clinic exists and is approved (is_approved = t). The issue is that the route is failing due to the URL building error in the template. Let me check what's causing the routing error by looking at the clinic profile template:


Opened templates/clinic/profile.html
I see the issue in the template - it's trying to use url_for('web.procedure_detail', procedure_id=procedure.id) but the web.procedure_detail route doesn't exist. Let me check the routing error and fix it by looking at the actual procedure detail route name.


Searched for ""

Searched for "procedure detail route or procedure view route definition"
Now I see the issue. The clinic profile template has a broken URL reference to url_for('web.procedure_detail', procedure_id=procedure.id) but the actual route is procedure_detail under the web blueprint. Let me fix this template error:

Let me search for the correct route name and fix the template error that's causing the routing issue:
