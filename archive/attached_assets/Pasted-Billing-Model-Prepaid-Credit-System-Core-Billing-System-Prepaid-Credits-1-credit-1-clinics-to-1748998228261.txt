Billing Model: Prepaid Credit System

Core Billing System
Prepaid Credits: 1 credit = ₹1, clinics top-up in advance
Dynamic Lead Pricing: Cost varies by package price range (₹100-500 credits)
Instant Deduction: Credits deducted when user clicks chat/call
Dispute System: Clinics can request refunds for invalid leads
Promotional Bonuses: Extra credits on high-value top-ups
Lead Pricing Tiers (Your Model)
< ₹5,000 packages → 100 credits per lead
₹5,000-₹10,000 → 180 credits per lead
₹10,000-₹20,000 → 250 credits per lead
₹20,000-₹50,000 → 320 credits per lead
₹50,000-₹100,000 → 400 credits per lead
₹100,000+ → 500 credits per lead

Compatibility Considerations
✅ Preserves Existing Features

Current lead generation flow remains intact
Package creation system unaffected
Admin verification workflows preserved
⚠️ Required Updates

Lead generation routes need credit validation
Dashboard templates need credit display
Admin routes need dispute management




Implementation Timeline:
Database schema + basic credit system
Razorpay integration + top-up flow
Dynamic pricing + lead generation updates
Dispute system + admin interface
Dashboard enhancements + testing


I've reviewed the plan thoroughly and it looks comprehensive. However, I want to highlight a few considerations before we proceed:

Missing Elements to Consider:
Credit Balance Validation: allow lead generation when credits are insufficient, with negative balance with alerts

Minimum Top-up Amount:  ₹1000 minimum

Admin Credit Adjustment:  admins should  be able to manually add/deduct credits for special cases and promotions


Payment gateway: razorpay


Current Implementation Compatibility:
The plan preserves all existing functionality:

Package creation and display remains unchanged
Current lead generation flow gets enhanced (not replaced)
Admin dashboard gains new credit management features
Clinic dashboard gets credit widgets added

The implementation should be done incrementally, so existing features continue working while we add the billing layer on top.
