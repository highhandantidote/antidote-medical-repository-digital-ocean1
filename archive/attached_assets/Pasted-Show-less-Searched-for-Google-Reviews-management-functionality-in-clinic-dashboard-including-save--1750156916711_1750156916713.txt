Searched for "Google Reviews management functionality in clinic dashboard including save business URL and sync reviews"
I can see the Google Reviews functionality is implemented but there are errors when saving the Google Business URL and syncing reviews. Let me examine the current route implementations and check for any missing endpoints or issues.


Opened google_reviews_routes.py
Now I need to check if the Google Reviews routes are properly registered in the main application and examine the Google Places service that handles the actual API calls.


Searched for "google_reviews_bp blueprint registration in main app or routes file"
I can see the Google Reviews routes are imported but need to check if they're properly registered. Let me also examine the Google Places service and the unified dashboard template to identify the source of the errors.


Opened routes.py

Opened routes.py
I need to check if the Google Reviews routes are properly registered and examine the Google Places service implementation.


Executed grep -n "google_reviews_bp" routes.py
Good, the Google Reviews routes are properly registered. Now I need to check the Google Places service implementation and examine the specific errors.


Opened google_places_service.py
I can see the issue. The Google Reviews functionality is implemented but requires the GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY environment variable to work properly. The service is failing because this API key is not configured.

The Google Reviews functionality is failing because the Google Places API key is missing. This API key is required to validate Google Business URLs and sync authentic reviews from Google.

To enable Google Reviews functionality in your clinic dashboard, we need a Google Places API key. This key allows the system to:

Validate Google Business URLs when you enter them
Sync authentic reviews from your Google My Business profile
Display real customer ratings and feedback on your clinic page
To get this API key:

Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com)
Create a new project or select an existing one
Enable the "Places API" service
Go to "Credentials" and create an API key
Restrict the key to only use the Places API for security
Once you provide the GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY, the "Save Google Business URL" and "Sync Reviews Now" buttons will work properly.

Perfect! Now that the Google Places API key is configured, let me test the Google Reviews functionality to ensure it's working properly.


Took a screenshot
✓ Google Places API key configured successfully
✓ Google Reviews system registered and running
✓ Server restarted with new API credentials

The Google Reviews functionality in your clinic dashboard should now work properly. Try clicking on the "Google Reviews" tab and test both buttons:

Enter your Google Business URL and click "Save Google Business URL"
Click "Sync Reviews Now" to fetch your authentic reviews
Are both buttons working without errors now?

I can see the issue from the logs - there are CSRF token errors and JavaScript errors. Let me examine the unified dashboard template to fix the Google Reviews functionality.


Opened templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
I can see the issues. The Google Reviews functionality has two main problems:

The form is missing CSRF tokens
The JavaScript is trying to call a non-existent endpoint /clinic/google-reviews/update-business-url instead of /clinic/google-reviews/configure
Let me fix these issues:


Opened templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
I need to find the Google Reviews form section and fix the CSRF token and endpoint issues.


Executed grep -n "Google Reviews" templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html

Opened templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
Now I can see the issue. The form is missing the CSRF token and the JavaScript is calling the wrong endpoint. Let me fix these problems:


Edited templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
Now I need to fix the JavaScript function to call the correct endpoint and add CSRF token support:


Edited templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
Now I need to add CSRF token support to the sync reviews function as well:


Edited templates/clinic/unified_dashboard.html
I need to also check if there's a missing endpoint for listing reviews. Let me examine the Google Reviews routes to see if we need to add the /clinic/google-reviews/list endpoint that the JavaScript is trying to call:

I need to add the missing /clinic/google-reviews/list endpoint that the JavaScript is trying to call. Let me add this route to the Google Reviews system:

Yes, that's exactly the right process! The Google shortened URL https://g.co/kgs/reLNZoc that you got from clicking "Share" on a Google Maps listing is perfect for our system.

I can see from the logs that the system is already working - it's successfully processing your URL:

It followed the shortened g.co link
It extracted the clinic information
It made API calls to Google Places to get the business details
The system is designed to handle various Google URL formats including:

Shortened g.co/kgs/ links (like yours)
Full Google Maps URLs
Google My Business URLs
Direct Place IDs
Your https://g.co/kgs/reLNZoc link is working correctly. The API calls in the logs show it's successfully connecting to Google's services and retrieving the business information.

Try using that URL in the Google Business URL field and click "Save Google Business URL" - it should work properly now with the fixes I made to the CSRF tokens and endpoints.

great. we fetched ratings and reviews successfully. now the actual ratings and reviews are not matching on the public facing clinic profile page. i still see random ratings insted of the correct ones. . lets add a review section on the clinic profile template too. we can show them like testimonials. or "what users say"

Perfect! I can see the Google Reviews sync is working successfully - the logs show it's fetching authentic reviews from Google Places API. Now I need to update the public clinic profile page to display these real Google reviews instead of the placeholder ratings.

Let me first examine the current clinic profile template to see how ratings are displayed:

I'll add a comprehensive Google Reviews section to the clinic profile template. Let me find a good place to insert it and create a "What Our Patients Say" section that displays authentic Google reviews.


Opened templates/clinic_profile.html
Perfect! I can see the existing Reviews section at line 320-336. I'll replace this placeholder section with an authentic Google Reviews display that shows real reviews fetched from the Google Places API.


Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I need to add JavaScript to load and display the authentic Google reviews on the clinic profile page. Let me add the JavaScript code to fetch and render the reviews:


Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I'll update the clinic profile page to show authentic Google ratings instead of placeholder ratings in the header section. Let me also update other clinic listing pages to use real Google ratings.


Edited templates/clinic_profile.html
Now I'll update the clinic listing pages to ensure they also display authentic Google ratings instead of placeholder data. Let me start with the main clinic directory page:


Edited templates/clinic/all_clinics.html
Now I'll update the marketplace clinic listing page to use authentic Google ratings as well:

I can see from the screenshot that the clinic profile page is displaying but there's no Google Reviews section visible. The page shows clinic highlights, procedures, treatment results, specialists, packages, and doctors, but the Google Reviews functionality isn't appearing. Let me investigate and fix this issue.


Opened templates/clinic_profile.html
I can see the clinic profile template has the Google rating display in the header, but there's no dedicated Google Reviews section visible on the page. Let me check the full template to see if there's a reviews section and add the "What Our Patients Say" section with authentic Google reviews.

I can see the issues clearly now. The clinic profile page is showing incorrect ratings (4.8/847 instead of 4.7/145) and the "What Our Patients Say" section is missing entirely. Let me fix both problems.

First, let me check the current clinic data and fix the rating display:


Executed SQL query SELECT id, name, google_rating, google_review_count, rating, review_count FROM clinics WHERE id = 26;
I can see the issue clearly. The clinic has the correct Google ratings (4.7/145) but the template is displaying the old rating field (4.8/847) instead of the Google ratings. I need to fix the template to show the correct Google ratings and add the missing "What Our Patients Say" section.


Opened templates/clinic_profile.html
I can see the template is correctly set up to display Google ratings, but there's an issue with the data access. The clinic profile route I created is using direct SQL queries and might not be properly accessing the Google rating fields. Let me fix the route and ensure the "What Our Patients Say" section is properly added.


Edited routes.py
Now I need to add the missing "What Our Patients Say" section to the clinic profile template. Let me insert it in the proper location after the doctors section.


Opened templates/clinic_profile.html
I can see the "What Our Patients Say" section is already in the template, but there's a routing conflict preventing the proper page from loading. The error shows that the clinic routes are conflicting with existing endpoints. Let me fix this routing issue.


Opened routes.py
I need to fix the routing conflict and ensure the clinic profile page displays the correct Google ratings. The issue is that there are multiple clinic routes competing for the same endpoint.
