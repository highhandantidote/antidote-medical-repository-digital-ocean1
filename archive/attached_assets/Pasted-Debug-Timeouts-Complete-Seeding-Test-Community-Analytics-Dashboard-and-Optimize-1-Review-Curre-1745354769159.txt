Debug Timeouts, Complete Seeding, Test Community Analytics Dashboard, and Optimize:

1. Review Current State:
   - Confirm `test_report.md` reflects 5 procedures and 6 threads, with performance metrics (e.g., load times <2s, API response times <500ms).
   - Analyze `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log` for timeout errors and debug traces (e.g., SQL query failures).

2. Debug Database Timeouts:
   - Investigate timeout causes in `run_seeding.py`—check connection pool settings in PostgreSQL or increase timeout limits (e.g., adjust `statement_timeout`).
   - Test `seed_procedures_sql.py` and `seed_community_threads_sql.py` with smaller batches (e.g., 10 procedures at a time) to isolate the issue. Log execution times for each batch.
   - Verify database health with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; and ensure no deadlocks or locks with: SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE waiting;

3. Complete Database Seeding:
   - Use `seed_procedures_sql.py` to seed all 117 procedures, ensuring required fields (e.g., procedure_name, body_part, category_id) align with the RealSelf hierarchy. Spot-check IDs 1, 13, 50 with: SELECT id, procedure_name, body_part FROM procedures WHERE id IN (1, 13, 50).
   - Verify the 6 threads (e.g., “Test Thread” with “cost” at 2 mentions, 5 Face, 1 Breast) with: SELECT id, title, content, created_at, procedure_id, keywords FROM threads LIMIT 6.
   - Ensure `/api/community/trends` returns “cost” with 2 mentions.

4. Test Community Analytics Dashboard:
   - Verify `/dashboard/community` in `dashboard_community.html`:
     - Confirm “Top Trends” bar chart renders “cost” with 2 mentions, <200ms rendering, labels, and tooltips.
     - Ensure body part distribution pie chart renders Face: 5, Breast: 1, <200ms rendering, legend, and tooltips.
     - Check filter dropdown updates to 5 threads for “Face” with <100ms lag, logging changes with timestamps.
   - Ensure `/community` in `community.html` shows only discussions (search, threads, “Create Thread”) with no analytics.

5. Finalize Optimizations:
   - Validate `static/js/community-analytics-updated.js` for lazy loading, debouncing, and timestamped logs—add debug logs for chart rendering and server errors.
   - Confirm `static/css/community-analytics.min.css` enhances load times.
   - Test real-time polling with `/api/community/trends`, logging an update after 5 minutes.

6. Respond:
   - Summarize: “Solid progress fixing the ‘now’ variable and creating optimized files, but timeouts are killing seeding—debug those with batching or PostgreSQL tweaks. Seed all 117 procedures, verify 6 threads, and test /dashboard/community for charts (e.g., ‘cost’ at 2 mentions, Face: 5, Breast: 1) and filters. Ensure /community has discussions only. I’ll confirm once working—next, run load testing.”
   - Share `test_report.md`, `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`, `routes.py`, `community.html`, `dashboard_community.html`, `seed_procedures_sql.py`, `seed_community_threads_sql.py`, `static/js/community-analytics-updated.js`, `static/css/community-analytics.min.css`, console output, and screenshots of `/community` (discussions) and `/dashboard/community` (analytics).

7. Next Steps:
   - Focus on resolving timeouts and completing seeding before load testing.
