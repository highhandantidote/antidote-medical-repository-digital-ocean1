Finalize AI Recommendations with RealSelf Hierarchy and Full Data Set:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Verify `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md` include all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics (page load times, API response times) for the current 16 procedures.
   - Ensure logs (e.g., `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`) contain relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Confirm screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community.

2. Refine Existing Schema and Data:
   - Use the current `Procedure` model in `models.py` (with `body_part`, `category`, `procedure_name`, `tags`, `min_cost`, `max_cost`) as the base, avoiding new migrations unless necessary.
   - Populate the existing `category` field with RealSelf-style categories during data migration, building on your updates:
     - Migrate the 16 procedures:
       - Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face, category=Rhinoplasty, procedure_name=Open Rhinoplasty, tags=["Surgical"].
       - Facelift: body_part=Face, category=Facelift, procedure_name=Full Facelift, tags=["Surgical"].
       - Eyelid Surgery: body_part=Face, category=Eyelid Surgery, procedure_name=Upper Eyelid Surgery, tags=["Surgical"].
       - Botox: body_part=Face, category=Injectables, procedure_name=Botox Injections, tags=["Non-Surgical"].
       - Lip Fillers: body_part=Face, category=Injectables, procedure_name=Lip Filler Injections, tags=["Non-Surgical"].
       - For the 11 added procedures, assign varied `body_part` (e.g., Breast, Body, Skin), `category` (e.g., Breast Augmentation, Liposuction), and `tags` (e.g., ["Surgical"], ["Non-Surgical"]) based on existing data, updating via SQL or `add_ten_procedures.py`.
   - Enhance `add_ten_procedures.py` to add 90 more procedures (total 100 new, reaching 116), with diverse `body_part` (e.g., Breast, Body, Skin, Legs), `category` (e.g., Breast Augmentation, Tummy Tuck), `procedure_name` (e.g., Silicone Implants, Laser Hair Removal), random `tags` (Surgical/Non-Surgical), and `min_cost`/`max_cost` ($300-$25,000). Use small batches (e.g., 10 at a time) to avoid timeouts, reusing the existing script.

3. Optimize AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Refine `ai_recommendations.py` to use the current schema, ensuring the similarity-based model (not collaborative filtering) works with `body_part`, `category`, and `tags`:
     - Example code:
       ```python
       from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
       import numpy as np
       from models import Procedure
       import joblib

       def get_recommendations(procedure_id):
           try:
               similarity_matrix = joblib.load('similarity_matrix.pkl')
               procedures = Procedure.query.all()
           except:
               procedures = Procedure.query.all()
               features = [[1 if p.body_part == "Face" else 0, 1 if p.category == "Rhinoplasty" else 0, 
                            1 if "Surgical" in p.tags else 0, p.min_cost, p.max_cost] for p in procedures]
               similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(features)
               joblib.dump(similarity_matrix, 'similarity_matrix.pkl')
           idx = [p.id for p in procedures].index(procedure_id)
           similar_indices = similarity_matrix[idx].argsort()[::-1][1:4]  # Top 3 similar
           return [procedures[i] for i in similar_indices]

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           recs = get_recommendations(1)  # Assuming ID 1 is Open Rhinoplasty
           for p in recs:
               print(f"Recommended: {p.procedure_name}")
Maintain caching with joblib to handle 116 procedures and avoid Replit timeouts.
Verify routes.py (/procedure_detail) integration uses the updated function, building on your existing endpoint.
Ensure procedure_detail.html displays recommendations correctly, adjusting for the new schema.
Enhance Category Visualization:
Refine the UI visualization in existing templates to match RealSelf’s hierarchy, using your current procedure_detail.html:
Body Part: Display as main navigation tabs or a sidebar (e.g., “Face,” “Breast,” “Body”) in base.html or /procedures, allowing filtering.
Category: Show as sub-sections or a dropdown under each body_part (e.g., under “Face,” list “Rhinoplasty,” “Facelift”) in /procedures or procedure_detail.html.
Procedure: List within each category on detail pages (e.g., “Open Rhinoplasty”) in procedure_detail.html, with recommendations below.
Tags: Render as clickable badges or filters (e.g., “Surgical”) on procedure_detail.html.
Update procedure_detail.html and /procedures route/template to reflect this, enhancing your JavaScript for dynamic loading, without creating new files.
Provide Output and Improvements:
Share updated models.py, test_report.md, ai_implementation_report.md, ai_recommendations.py, add_ten_procedures.py, routes.py, procedure_detail.html, base.html (if modified), logs, console output, and screenshots showing the hierarchy visualization (navigation tabs, category sub-sections, procedure listings, tags, and recommendations) for 16 and 116 procedures.
Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed and performance metrics included—please review test_report.md and ai_implementation_report.md, logs, and screenshots. Schema refined with 16 procedures migrated and 90 added (total 116) using add_ten_procedures.py. AI tool optimized to a similarity-based model, tested successfully with caching—please review ai_recommendations.py and screenshots. Category visualization enhanced as specified—please review updated templates and screenshots. Data can be cleaned with cleanup_test_data.py. To improve, consider adding more tag variety (e.g., Reconstructive) and testing UI load times with 116 procedures. Next, enhance the AI with community analytics to identify trending threads, using the 5 existing threads.
