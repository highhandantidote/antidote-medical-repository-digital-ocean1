Google Reviews management is now active! Here's what's been added:

✓ New "Google Reviews" tab in your clinic dashboard
✓ Google Business URL configuration interface
✓ Real-time review syncing with Google Places API
✓ Authentic review display with ratings and customer photos
✓ Automatic weekly sync after initial setup

How to use it:

Click the "Google Reviews" tab in your dashboard
Enter your Google Business URL (from Google Maps or Google My Business)
Click "Save Google Business URL" to connect
Use "Sync Reviews Now" to fetch your authentic reviews immediately
The system will automatically sync your Google Business reviews and display them on your clinic profile page. This replaces any placeholder reviews with your actual customer feedback and ratings.

Can you try clicking on the "Google Reviews" tab now and let me know if you can see the new management interface?
