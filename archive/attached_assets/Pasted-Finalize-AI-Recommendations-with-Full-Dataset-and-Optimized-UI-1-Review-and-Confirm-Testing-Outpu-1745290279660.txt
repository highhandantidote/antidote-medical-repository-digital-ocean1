Finalize AI Recommendations with Full Dataset and Optimized UI:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Verify `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md` include all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics (page load times, API response times) for the 17 procedures.
   - Ensure logs (e.g., `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`) contain relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Confirm screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community.

2. Complete Data Population:
   - Use the current `Procedure` model with `body_part`, `category_id`, `procedure_name`, `tags`, `min_cost`, `max_cost`, and related `body_parts` and `categories` tables.
   - Confirm the 17 procedures match the RealSelf hierarchy (e.g., Open Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face, category_id for Rhinoplasty, tags=["Surgical"]). Adjust any mismatches using your SQL updates.
   - Run `add_ten_procedures.py` in small batches (e.g., 10 at a time) to add 90 more procedures (total 100 new, reaching 117), with diverse `body_part` (e.g., Breast, Body, Skin, Legs), `category_id` (e.g., Breast Augmentation, Tummy Tuck), `procedure_name` (e.g., Silicone Implants, Laser Hair Removal), random `tags` (Surgical, Non-Surgical, Reconstructive), and `min_cost`/`max_cost` ($300-$25,000). Log each batch’s completion.

3. Optimize AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Refine `ai_recommendations.py` to maintain the similarity-based model with your caching and ID mapping:
     - Ensure it handles 117 procedures efficiently with `joblib`.
     - Run `test_recommendations_simple.py` to test specific procedures (e.g., ID 1: Open Rhinoplasty, ID 13: Breast Augmentation), logging recommendation accuracy and load times for 17 and 117 procedures.
   - Verify `routes.py` (`/procedure_detail`) integration uses the updated function.

4. Finalize Category Visualization and UI:
   - Refine `procedure_detail.html` and `/procedures` to perfect the “Recommended For You” section based on your updates:
     - **Body Part**: Ensure navigation tabs or sidebar (e.g., “Face,” “Breast”) in `base.html` or `/procedures` are prominent.
     - **Category**: Highlight as sub-sections or dropdowns (e.g., “Breast Augmentation”) in `/procedures` or above details.
     - **Procedure**: List `procedure_name` (e.g., “Breast Augmentation Standard”) boldly in cards.
     - **Tags**: Display as clickable badges (e.g., “Surgical”) on cards.
     - **Recommendations**: Enhance cards:
       - Add a 50x50px placeholder image (e.g., a gray square) on the left of each card.
       - Move ratings to a star icon (e.g., ★ 0.0) above the cost, using a library like Font Awesome if available.
       - Ensure three cards fit without overflow, adjusting font size (e.g., 14px for names, 12px for details) if needed.
       - Retain your hover effect on “Learn More” buttons.
   - Update JavaScript to dynamically load recommendations and filter by `tags`, ensuring efficiency with 117 procedures.

5. Finalize Documentation and Output:
   - Update `test_report.md` with test results for 17 and 117 procedures, including load times.
   - Enhance `ai_implementation_report.md` with details on batch processing, caching, and UI enhancements.
   - Share updated `models.py`, `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, `ai_recommendations.py`, `add_ten_procedures.py`, `test_recommendations_simple.py`, `routes.py`, `procedure_detail.html`, `base.html` (if modified), logs, console output, and screenshots showing the enhanced “Recommended For You” section for 17 and 117 procedures.
   - Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed and performance metrics included—please review `test_report.md` and `ai_implementation_report.md`, logs, and screenshots. Data finalized with 17 procedures migrated and 90 added (total 117) using `add_ten_procedures.py`. AI tool optimized to a similarity-based model, tested on IDs 1 and 13—please review `ai_recommendations.py` and screenshots. Category visualization and UI finalized as specified—please review updated templates and screenshots. Data can be cleaned with `cleanup_test_data.py`. The UI is spot on; consider replacing placeholders with real images later. Next, enhance the AI with community analytics to identify trending threads, using the 5 existing threads."
