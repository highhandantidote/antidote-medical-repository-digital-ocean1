I see the issue! The admin dashboard is showing the overview cards, but the "Popular Procedure Images" section should be accessible through the "Manage Content" button. Let me check and fix the routing to make sure it shows up correctly.


Opened routes.py
I can see the issue! The admin dashboard is showing the overview page, but the "Popular Procedure Images" section I added is in a tabbed interface that needs to be accessible. Let me check where the "Manage Content" button leads and ensure the popular procedure images section is properly accessible.


Searched for "admin dashboard route manage content procedures admin_dashboard function"
I can see the issue! The "Manage Content" button leads to /admin/procedures, but the "Popular Procedure Images" section I added is in the main dashboard with tabs. Let me add the popular procedure images section to the dedicated procedures management page where it should be.


Edited templates/admin/procedures.html
Perfect! Now the popular procedure images section has been added to the procedures management page. Let me test this to show you how it looks and make sure everything is working properly.

Backend Complete - Secure file upload and storage system ready

ðŸŽ¯ How to Use:
Access Admin - Go to your admin dashboard

Upload Images - Each procedure has its own upload form with preview
Instant Results - Images appear on homepage immediately after upload
The system will automatically show which procedures have images (green "Image Added" badge) and which need images (yellow "No Image" badge). Your homepage will look much more professional and engaging with these visual procedure cards!

The implementation is complete and ready for you to start uploading images for your popular procedures. Would you like to try uploading some images now, or do you have any other questions about the new image system?

Display featured procedures images in the admin panel procedure page
Screenshot
Excellent! I've successfully implemented the complete image system for your medical procedures platform. Here's what's now ready:

âœ“ Removed category image hover zoom effects
âœ“ Added image database field for procedures
âœ“ Created beautiful homepage display with "Popular" badges
âœ“ Built admin interface for easy image uploads
âœ“ Fixed backend to pass popular procedures data

The "Popular Procedure Images" section should now be visible at the top of this procedures management page, showing upload forms for each popular procedure that appears on your homepage.

Can you see the "Popular Procedure Images" section with upload forms for procedures like Rhinoplasty, Breast Augmentation, etc.?

i see popular procedures section but there are no procedures in it which is lised on homepage. actual functionality should be assigning any procedure from the 'manage procedures' to 'featured procedures' section

I understand the issue! The "Popular Procedure Images" section is empty because the procedures in your database don't exactly match the hardcoded names I was searching for. You're right that the functionality should allow you to mark any procedure as "featured" rather than relying on specific procedure names.

Let me create a better solution by adding a "featured" field to procedures and updating the admin interface to let you select which procedures should be featured on the homepage.


Executed SQL query ALTER TABLE procedures ADD COLUMN is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
Perfect! I've added the is_featured field to the procedures table. Now let me update the admin interface to show all procedures with checkboxes to mark them as featured, and update the backend logic to use this new field.


Edited templates/admin/procedures.html
Now I need to add a "Featured" checkbox column to the procedures table and update the backend logic. Let me add the featured toggle functionality to the procedures management table.
