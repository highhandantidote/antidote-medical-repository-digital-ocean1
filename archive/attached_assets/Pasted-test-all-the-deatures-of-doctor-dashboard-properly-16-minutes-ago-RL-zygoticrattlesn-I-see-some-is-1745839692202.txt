I see some issues from the console logs. Let's fix the main problem, which is the missing csrf_token in the doctor dashboard. The error is:

ERROR:routes:Error rendering doctor dashboard: 'csrf_token' is undefined
This is why the doctor dashboard isn't loading properly. Let's fix it by ensuring CSRF protection is enabled and properly imported in our routes:


Opened main.py

Opened app.py
Let's update the app.py file to explicitly initialize Flask-WTF CSRF protection:


Edited app.py
Now let's add the CSRF initialization to the create_app function:


Edited app.py
Now we need to add the CSRF initialization to the create_app function:


Edited app.py
Now, let's modify the dashboard_doctor.html template to use the correct CSRF token implementation:


Edited templates/dashboard_doctor.html
Now we need to update the routes.py file to ensure that the CSRF form is passed to the template:


Searched for "Find the dashboard_doctor route in routes.py"
Now let's fix the doctor_dashboard route in routes.py to include the CSRF form:


Opened routes.py
Let's create a form for review replies:


Edited routes.py
Now let's modify the doctor_dashboard route to pass the form to the template:


Searched for ""
I'm analyzing our progress on fixing the doctor dashboard features.

Looking at what we've done so far:
✓ Fixed review reply functionality structure in dashboard_doctor.html
✓ Added JavaScript for the reply interaction
✓ Added CSRF protection
→ Testing all doctor dashboard features

I'll continue working to test and fix remaining doctor dashboard features.

Now let's modify the doctor_dashboard route to pass the form to the template. First, I'll find where this function is defined in the routes.py file:


Opened routes.py
Let's find the main doctor dashboard route:


Opened routes.py
Let's search for the main doctor dashboard route:


Executed grep -n "def doctor_dashboard" routes.py
Great! Now let's view the doctor_dashboard function and modify it to include the CSRF form:


Opened routes.py

Opened routes.py
Now let's modify the doctor_dashboard function to include the review reply form:


Edited routes.py
Let's also update the error case for doctor_dashboard to include the form:


Edited routes.py
Now let's modify the reply_review function to properly handle CSRF:


Opened routes.py
Let's continue viewing the reply_review function:


Opened routes.py
Now let's update the reply_review function to use the form for better CSRF handling:


Edited routes.py
I'm analyzing your progress with the doctor dashboard features. Let me review what's been done and what's still in progress.

Looking at the recent work:
✓ Added proper reply form to doctor reviews section
✓ Implemented JavaScript to handle reply button interactions
✓ Added CSRF protection for the application
✓ Created ReviewReplyForm for better form handling
✓ Updated doctor_dashboard route to pass the form to templates
→ Testing all doctor dashboard features

I'm making good progress on improving the doctor dashboard. I'll continue working on testing and fixing the remaining features.

Improve security when doctors reply to patient reviews on dashboard
Screenshot
I can see that our server has restarted successfully. The CSRF form implementation for the doctor dashboard and review reply functionality has been completed. Now, let's focus on the patient leads action buttons.

Let's review the "View" lead functionality first. I'll examine the doctor_leads template and the view_lead route to ensure they're properly linked:


Opened templates/doctor_leads.html
Let's look at the action buttons in the doctor_leads.html file and check the corresponding JavaScript:


Executed grep -n "lead-action-btn" templates/doctor_leads.html
Now let's check the JavaScript file that handles these lead action buttons:


Opened static/js/leads.js
Now let's check the routes that handle these lead actions:


Executed grep -n "def view_lead" routes.py
Let's examine the view_lead function:


Opened routes.py

Opened routes.py
Let's check if the "view_lead.html" template exists:


Opened templates/view_lead.html
Let's check if the contact_lead.html template exists:


Opened templates/contact_lead.html
Let's check if the update_lead_status.html template exists:


Opened templates/update_lead_status.html
Now that I've reviewed all the templates and routes, the issue appears to be with the URLs in the JavaScript code. The lead action buttons have URLs configured in the format /lead/{id}/action but in the templates, they use the correct Flask route URLs.

Let's fix the JavaScript in leads.js to match the correct URLs:


Edited static/js/leads.js
