Finalize Community Analytics Dashboard and Plan Real-Time Updates:

1. Review and Confirm Testing Output:
   - Confirm `test_report.md` includes all test case results (Approve/Reject Doctors, Procedure Listing, Community Threads) and performance metrics for 117 procedures and 5 threads.
   - Ensure `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log` contains relevant entries (e.g., DEBUG:routes:Verification approved, INFO:db:COMMIT).
   - Verify screenshots cover /dashboard/doctor/verify, /procedures, and /community/analytics.

2. Verify Data Population:
   - Confirm the 117 procedures match the RealSelf hierarchy (e.g., Open Rhinoplasty: body_part=Face) with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procedures; and spot-check IDs 1, 13, 50.
   - Validate the 5 sample threads with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads; and spot-check with: SELECT id, title, content, created_at, procedure_id FROM threads LIMIT 5.
   - Verify trending topics by checking keyword frequency (e.g., “Rhinoplasty,” “cost,” “recovery”) in thread content with a manual query or log output.

3. Verify and Finalize AI Tool - Procedure Recommendations:
   - Confirm `ai_recommendations.py` handles 117 procedures efficiently with weighted features and caching.
   - Verify `test_recommendation_endpoint.py` results for IDs 1 and 13, ensuring accuracy and load times.
   - Confirm `routes.py` (`/procedure_detail`) and API endpoints return expected results.

4. Verify and Finalize Community Analytics Dashboard:
   - Review the `/community/analytics` dashboard in `community.html`:
     - Confirm the top 3 trending topics are displayed with keyword counts (e.g., “Rhinoplasty: 15”) in both chart and list formats.
     - Verify the body part distribution pie chart is clear and accurate.
     - Ensure the body part filter dropdown (e.g., Face, Breast) works, filtering threads dynamically.
     - Confirm the “Start Discussion” button is active, linking to `/community/new` (even if a placeholder page).
     - Validate the layout is clean and readable, adjusting spacing or sizing if needed.
   - Respond to the dashboard question: “The Community Analytics dashboard looks great! I can see the trending topics with counts, the body part distribution pie chart, and the filter dropdown works. The ‘Start Discussion’ button is active, which is excellent. Please ensure the top 3 trending topics list is clearly labeled (e.g., ‘Top Trends’) and the pie chart legend is visible. Adjust layout spacing for readability if necessary.”
   - Update `static/js/community-analytics.js` to enhance dynamic loading and filtering efficiency with 5 threads.

5. Finalize Documentation and Plan Real-Time Updates:
   - Update `test_report.md` with final test results for 117 procedures and 5 threads, including dashboard validation.
   - Enhance `ai_implementation_report.md` with UI details (card layout, tag filtering) and community analytics implementation (Thread model, dashboard features, keyword analysis), plus a plan for real-time updates:
     - **Real-Time Plan**: Use WebSocket or polling to update trending topics and thread counts every 5 minutes. Add user engagement metrics (e.g., views, replies) to the dashboard.
     - **Next Steps**: Implement a `/community/new` route and template for thread creation, integrating with the `Thread` model.
   - Share updated `models.py`, `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, `ai_recommendations.py`, `add_procedures_sql.py`, `test_recommendation_endpoint.py`, `routes.py`, `procedure_detail.html`, `base.html` (if modified), `community.html`, `seed_community_threads.py`, `static/js/community-analytics.js`, `antidote_full_test_20250421_234956.log`, console output, and screenshots showing the finalized `/community/analytics` dashboard.
   - Respond: "Testing output confirmed, with all test cases passed and performance metrics included—please review `test_report.md`, `ai_implementation_report.md`, logs, and screenshots. Data finalized with 117 procedures and 5 threads. AI tool optimized and tested on IDs 1 and 13—please review `ai_recommendations.py` and screenshots. Community analytics dashboard finalized—please review `community.html` and screenshots. Data can be cleaned with `cleanup_test_data.py`. Next, implement real-time updates and the `/community/new` page.”
