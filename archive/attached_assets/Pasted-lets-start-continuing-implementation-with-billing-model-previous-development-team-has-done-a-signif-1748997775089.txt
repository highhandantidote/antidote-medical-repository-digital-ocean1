Integrating with Stripe, Supabase Database

Restarted Start application
I'll analyze the current billing system implementation and continue from where the development team left off. Let me first examine the existing credit system components.


Searched for "Find existing credit billing system implementation, payment routes, and clinic dashboard features related to credits"
Based on my analysis, I can see the development team has made significant progress on the billing system. Let me provide you with the current implementation status and continue from where they left off.

Current Billing System Progress
✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:

Database schema for CreditTransaction model with all required fields
Basic credit billing service with dynamic pricing tiers (₹100-500 credits)
Credit balance calculation and transaction history
Clinic billing dashboard with credit display
Credit top-up interface with promotional packages
Lead cost calculation based on package price ranges
⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:

Payment routes exist but Razorpay integration needs API keys
Credit deduction logic exists but needs integration with lead generation
Admin billing overview partially implemented
❌ MISSING FEATURES:

Lead disputes system
Razorpay webhook handling
Real-time credit validation in lead generation
Admin credit adjustment functionality
Promotional bonus logic implementation
Let me now implement the missing features starting with the core billing enhancements:

To complete the credit billing system with payment integration, I need your Razorpay API credentials. These will enable secure credit top-ups and payment processing for clinics.

Razorpay API keys are required for:

Processing credit purchases securely
Handling payment confirmations via webhooks
Managing promotional bonuses on successful payments
Ensuring PCI-compliant transaction processing
Please provide your Razorpay Key ID and Key Secret from your Razorpay dashboard.

Perfect! I can see the Razorpay client has been initialized successfully. Now I'll continue implementing the billing system from where the development team left off. Let me first examine the current database structure and then implement the missing features.


Executed SQL query SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name IN ('clinics', 'credit_transactions', 'leads') ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
I can see the database structure is ready. Now I'll implement the missing billing system features. Let me first add the credit_balance field to the clinics table and create the lead disputes table.


Executed SQL query ALTER TABLE clinics ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS credit_balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

Executed SQL query CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lead_disputes ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, lead_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES leads(id), clinic_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES clinics(id), reason TEXT NOT NULL, status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', admin_notes TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, resolved_at TIMESTAMP, resolved_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) );
Now I'll implement the comprehensive billing system enhancements. Let me start by creating the enhanced credit billing service with all the missing features.


Created enhanced_credit_billing.py
Now I'll create the lead disputes system and update the existing lead generation flow to integrate credit deduction. Let me implement the disputes functionality first.


Created lead_disputes_system.py
Let me fix the LSP errors in the credit billing system and continue implementing the complete billing features.


Edited enhanced_credit_billing.py
I'm fixing the remaining issues and continuing with the billing system implementation. Let me resolve the type errors and complete the integration.

Can you test the clinic dashboard billing features? Please check if the credit balance is displayed and if the billing tab shows the pricing tiers correctly.

document all the code you have written and the routes,templates, files etc.. you used in the current implementation. also create a .md file to explain the current implementations in our billing model. this should help the developers to easily understand and use correct files and routing, template etc..
