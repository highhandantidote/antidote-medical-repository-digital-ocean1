# Data Import Milestone Report

## Summary of Accomplishments
- **Procedures**: Successfully imported 52 new procedures (from 436 to 488)
- **Doctors**: Successfully imported 25 new doctors (from 13 to 38)
- **Total Records**: Added 77 new records to the database

## Import Method Optimization
After evaluating multiple approaches, we determined that direct SQL insertions provided the most reliable and efficient method for importing data. This approach:

1. Minimized timeout issues by processing records in small batches
2. Preserved data integrity by avoiding schema changes
3. Ensured all required fields were properly populated
4. Handled constraints appropriately with default values and truncation when needed

## Data Integrity Considerations
Throughout the import process, we maintained strict adherence to database constraints:

- Required fields were populated with appropriate values
- Text fields were truncated when necessary to meet column limits
- Categories and body parts were properly associated
- No existing data was modified or deleted
