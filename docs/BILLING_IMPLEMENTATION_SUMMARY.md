### 2. Database Setup Required

```sql
-- Credit transactions table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS credit_transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    clinic_id INTEGER REFERENCES clinics(id),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    lead_id INTEGER REFERENCES leads(id),
    payment_id VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'completed',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Lead disputes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lead_disputes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id INTEGER REFERENCES leads(id),
    clinic_id INTEGER REFERENCES clinics(id),
    dispute_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    admin_notes TEXT,
    refund_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_credit_transactions_clinic_id ON credit_transactions(clinic_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_credit_transactions_created_at ON credit_transactions(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_lead_disputes_clinic_id ON lead_disputes(clinic_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_lead_disputes_status ON lead_disputes(status);
```

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for Razorpay integration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret_key

# Database connection (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### 4. Blueprint Registration

Add to your main `routes.py` file:

```python
# Import billing blueprints
from integrated_billing_system import billing_bp
from enhanced_credit_billing import enhanced_credit_bp
from lead_disputes_system import disputes_bp, admin_disputes_bp
from enhanced_lead_generation import enhanced_lead_bp

# Register blueprints
app.register_blueprint(billing_bp, url_prefix='/clinic')
app.register_blueprint(enhanced_credit_bp, url_prefix='/')
app.register_blueprint(disputes_bp, url_prefix='/clinic')
app.register_blueprint(admin_disputes_bp, url_prefix='/')
app.register_blueprint(enhanced_lead_bp, url_prefix='/')
```

### 5. Key Features Implemented

#### Dynamic Pricing System:
- 6 pricing tiers based on package value (₹100-500 credits)
- Automatic cost calculation during lead generation
- Real-time credit deduction

#### Payment Integration:
- Razorpay payment gateway integration
- Secure payment verification
- Automatic credit addition post-payment

#### Lead Quality Management:
- Dispute creation for low-quality leads
- Admin dispute resolution interface
- Automatic refunds for approved disputes

#### Clinic Dashboard Integration:
- Credit balance display in header
- Low balance alerts
- Billing tab with transaction history
- Pricing tier information

### 6. Usage Examples

#### Check Credit Balance:
```python
from integrated_billing_system import BillingService
balance = BillingService.get_clinic_credit_balance(clinic_id)
```

#### Process Lead with Billing:
```python
# Calculate cost based on package price
lead_cost = BillingService.calculate_lead_cost(package_price)

# Deduct credits automatically
success = BillingService.deduct_credits_for_lead(clinic_id, lead_cost, lead_id)
```

#### Add Credits:
```python
BillingService.add_credits(clinic_id, 1000, "Credit purchase via Razorpay")
```

### 7. Route Endpoints

#### Clinic Billing:
- `GET /clinic/billing-dashboard` - Main billing interface
- `GET /clinic/credits/topup` - Credit purchase page
- `GET /clinic/credits/history` - Transaction history

#### Payment Processing:
- `POST /create-razorpay-order` - Create payment order
- `POST /verify-payment` - Verify payment completion

#### Disputes:
- `GET /clinic/disputes` - Dispute management
- `POST /clinic/disputes/create/<lead_id>` - Create dispute
- `GET /admin/disputes` - Admin dispute review

#### Enhanced Lead Generation:
- `POST /contact-clinic` - Lead submission with billing

### 8. Testing the Implementation

#### Test Credit Balance:
1. Login as clinic owner
2. Navigate to `/clinic/dashboard`
3. Check credit balance in header
4. Click on "Credit Billing" tab

#### Test Lead Generation with Billing:
1. Submit a lead through package page
2. Verify credit deduction in transaction history
3. Check lead appears in clinic dashboard

#### Test Payment Integration:
1. Go to `/clinic/credits/topup`
2. Select credit package
3. Complete Razorpay payment flow
4. Verify credits added to account

#### Test Dispute System:
1. Create dispute for a lead
2. Login as admin
3. Review and resolve dispute
4. Verify refund processed

### 9. Performance Considerations

- Credit balances cached for 5 minutes
- Transaction history paginated (20 per page)
- Database indexes on critical columns
- Optimized SQL queries for dashboard metrics

### 10. Security Features

- CSRF token validation on all forms
- Razorpay signature verification
- Clinic-specific data isolation
- Admin-only dispute resolution access

### 11. Monitoring and Logs

Key log events to monitor:
- Credit deductions: `Credit deduction: Clinic {clinic_id}, Amount {amount}`
- Payment processing: `Payment verified: {payment_id}, Credits {amount}`
- Dispute creation: `Dispute created: Lead {lead_id}, Type {dispute_type}`
- Refund processing: `Refund processed: Dispute {dispute_id}, Amount {amount}`

### 12. Common Integration Issues

#### Payment Failures:
- Verify Razorpay credentials in environment
- Check network connectivity to Razorpay servers
- Ensure HTTPS for production payments

#### Credit Deduction Errors:
- Verify database connection and table structure
- Check lead generation flow integration
- Monitor for insufficient balance scenarios

#### Template Rendering Issues:
- Ensure all template variables passed correctly
- Check for missing CSS/JS dependencies
- Verify template inheritance structure
