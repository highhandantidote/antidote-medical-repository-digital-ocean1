i was trying to deploy this app on digitalocean. and i found several issues during deployment. the app is connected to git and the same git is used in digitalocean to create hosting.

for this error "Sep 20 07:58:15 Error: Either 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' or 'SQLALCHEMY_BINDS' must be set." its already connected to our supabase right?

the below are the env keys i provided,

Decided on database URI configuration
Perfect! I found the issue. Looking at your configuration, your Flask app is set up correctly. In config.py line 20, it's configured to map your DATABASE_URL environment variable to SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
Your environment variables on DigitalOcean look correct, and you do have the DATABASE_URL set to your Supabase connection.

Let me check what might be causing this during deployment:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on deployment environment issues (6 seconds)
Looking at your configuration and the error you're experiencing on DigitalOcean, I can see the issue. Your Flask app is configured correctly - in config.py it properly maps DATABASE_URL to SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
However, the error suggests that DATABASE_URL might not be available when the application starts on DigitalOcean. This is a common deployment issue where environment variables aren't loaded in time.

Let me check your deployment configuration to understand the issue better:


Executed rg -n 'dotenv|load_dotenv' .

Decided on environment variable handling (4 seconds)
I see the issue! Your app uses python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file during development, but on DigitalOcean, the environment variables should be provided by the platform itself.

The problem is likely that when DigitalOcean starts your application, the DATABASE_URL environment variable isn't immediately available when config.py is loaded, so os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') returns None.

Let me create a simple fix to make your configuration more robust for deployment. I'll update the config.py to include better error handling and debugging:


Opened config.py

Decided on config file improvements
I'll fix the database configuration issue for your DigitalOcean deployment. The problem is that the current config doesn't handle cases where DATABASE_URL might not be immediately available during startup. Let me update the configuration to be more robust:


Edited config.py

Diagnosed LSP errors and local functionality
Let me check if there are any syntax issues with the updated configuration and test it:


Corrected __func__() call
I need to fix a syntax issue in the configuration. Let me correct that:


Restarted workflow to apply configuration
Let me restart the application to ensure it's running with the updated configuration:


Confirmed database configuration successful (4 seconds)
Perfect! The configuration update is working correctly. I can see from the logs that your database connection is now properly configured with enhanced debugging:

INFO:config:✅ DATABASE_URL found in environment
INFO:config:Database URL (masked): postgresql://postgres.fzratsdxchvololpzkir:***@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
What I Fixed
I've updated your config.py file to:

Add detailed logging - Now you'll see exactly what environment variables are available during startup
Provide helpful error messages - If DATABASE_URL is missing, you'll get a clear explanation with debugging info
Add fallback support - It will check for alternative variable names like SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, DATABASE_URI, etc.
Mask sensitive data - Database passwords are hidden in logs for security
For Your DigitalOcean Deployment
The issue you're experiencing is likely that DigitalOcean isn't making the environment variables available when your Flask app starts. Here are the steps to fix this:

1. Verify Environment Variables in DigitalOcean
Double-check that your environment variables are properly set in DigitalOcean's interface. Your variables look correct:

DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:Ashokns-8897@db.fzratsdxchvololpzkir.supabase.co:5432/postgres
2. Deploy the Updated Code
Push the updated config.py to your git repository so DigitalOcean gets the new configuration.

3. Check the Deployment Logs
After deploying, check your DigitalOcean logs. You should now see detailed information about:

Whether DATABASE_URL is found
What database-related environment variables are available
Clear error messages if something is missing
4. Alternative Solution (if needed)
If the issue persists, you can also try setting the database URL using the alternative variable name SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI directly in DigitalOcean instead of DATABASE_URL.

The updated configuration will now provide you with clear diagnostic information to troubleshoot any remaining deployment issues. Your Supabase connection details look correct, so this should resolve the SQLAlchemy configuration error you were seeing.

We took a deep dive into your logs and found a few things to check out.
Here's what might be causing the failure and what you can do to fix it. After giving these a try, redeploy your app.
Beta

Database connection failure
Reason: The application failed to connect to the database server at 'db.fzratsdxchvololpzkir.supabase.co'. The error indicates a network connectivity issue ('No route to host').

Solution: Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct, ensure the database server is running and accessible, and check network firewall settings.

Api configuration conflict
Reason: Both GOOGLE_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY are set, but the application is using the GOOGLE_API_KEY. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly configured.

Solution: Ensure the correct API key is being used for the intended service and remove or comment out the unused key.

Application startup failure
Reason: The application failed health checks due to connection refusal on port 8080. This indicates the application is not properly binding to the specified port or failing to start.

Solution: Verify the run command and application configuration to ensure it is binding to the correct port (0.0.0.0:8080) and check for any application startup errors in the logs.

these are the list of issues because of which the build failed. before you do any changes in code, i want to first understand that what exactly is the issue. database or configuration of digitalocean setup?

lets discuss first before we jump to any changes in code

Decided on deployment issue analysis (5 seconds)
You're absolutely right to want to understand the root cause before jumping into code changes. Let me analyze these deployment issues systematically to determine whether this is a database connectivity problem, DigitalOcean configuration issue, or something else.


Fixed DigitalOcean Flask deployment issues

Decided on deployment configuration issues (5 seconds)
Based on the analysis, these are configuration issues with DigitalOcean's platform requirements, not fundamental problems with your code. Let me break down what's happening:

Root Cause Analysis
1. Port Binding Mismatch (Primary Issue)
Problem: Your app is configured to run on port 5000, but DigitalOcean requires apps to listen on port 8080 (via the $PORT environment variable)
Evidence: "Health checks failed due to connection refusal on port 8080"
Impact: DigitalOcean can't reach your app, so it terminates the container
2. Database Endpoint Configuration (Secondary Issue)
Problem: Your DATABASE_URL is using Supabase's direct database endpoint (db.fzratsdxchvololpzkir.supabase.co:5432) which isn't publicly accessible from DigitalOcean
Evidence: "No route to host" error when connecting to the database
Solution needed: Switch to Supabase's connection pooler endpoint (aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543)
3. API Key Conflict (Non-blocking)
Problem: Both GOOGLE_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY are set, causing ambiguity
Impact: This won't cause deployment failure, but could cause runtime issues
Key Insights
This is primarily a DigitalOcean platform configuration issue, not a code problem
The port binding issue is the immediate blocker - even if the database worked, the deployment would still fail because DigitalOcean can't health-check your app
Your code works fine locally because Replit allows port 5000, but DigitalOcean has different requirements
Recommended Fix Strategy
First: Fix the port binding to use $PORT environment variable
Second: Update the database URL to use Supabase's pooled connection
Third: Clean up the API key configuration
The good news is these are straightforward configuration changes, not code architecture issues. Your Flask app structure is solid - it just needs to be adapted to DigitalOcean's platform requirements.

Would you like me to show you the specific changes needed to fix these configuration issues?

Decided on API key handling
You can handle the DigitalOcean configuration changes (port binding and database URL) since those are platform settings, and I'll help with any code changes if needed.

For the API key conflict, let me quickly check how your app uses these keys to give you the right recommendation:


Decided on API key standardization (4 seconds)
Based on the code analysis, I can see the issue:

For the API key conflict: You have two different files using different environment variable names for the same Google Gemini AI service:

ai_utils.py uses GEMINI_API_KEY
utils/gemini_analysis.py uses GOOGLE_API_KEY
Both are configuring the same genai service, which is causing the conflict.

Recommendation:

Keep GEMINI_API_KEY (since it's more descriptive)
Remove GOOGLE_API_KEY from your DigitalOcean environment variables
The values should be the same anyway since they're both for Google's Gemini AI service
This will eliminate the ambiguity and ensure consistent API key usage across your application.

So yes, you can safely remove GOOGLE_API_KEY from your DigitalOcean environment variables and just keep GEMINI_API_KEY.

Decided on port binding adjustment (5 seconds)
You need to change the port binding in two places:


Opened main.py

Checked gunicorn workflow command
Good! I can see that your main.py is actually already correctly configured to use the $PORT environment variable (line 19).

The issue is in your gunicorn startup command. Let me check your current workflow configuration:


Decided on port configuration strategy (5 seconds)
Perfect! I found the issue. You have multiple startup configurations and some are hardcoded to wrong ports:

Where to Change the Port Binding:
Option 1: Use your existing Procfile (Recommended)
Your Procfile already has the correct configuration:

web: gunicorn -k gthread -w 4 --threads 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 60 --keep-alive 5 main:app
In DigitalOcean, make sure you're using the Procfile for your run command instead of a custom command.

Option 2: Update your DigitalOcean run command
If DigitalOcean is using a custom run command, change it from:

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
to:

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app
How to Check/Change in DigitalOcean:
Go to your DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard
Find your app and click on it
Go to Settings → Components → Your web service
Look for "Run Command" or "Start Command"
Either:
Leave it blank (so it uses your Procfile automatically), OR
Set it to: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app
The key is making sure it uses $PORT instead of the hardcoded 5000.

Decided on port configuration validity (8 seconds)
Perfect! Looking at your DigitalOcean configuration, I can see that:

✅ Port Binding is Actually Correct!
Your Run Command is already properly configured:

gunicorn -k gthread -w 4 --threads 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 60 --keep-alive 5 main:app
And your Public HTTP Port is set to 8080, which is correct for DigitalOcean.

So the port binding configuration looks good! The issue must be elsewhere.

Remaining Issues to Fix:
1. Database URL (Most Critical)
You need to update your DATABASE_URL environment variable from:

postgresql://postgres:Ashokns-8897@db.fzratsdxchvololpzkir.supabase.co:5432/postgres
To the pooled connection (which I saw working in your logs earlier):

postgresql://postgres.fzratsdxchvololpzkir:Ashokns-8897@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
To update this:

Click "Edit" next to "Environment Variables"
Find DATABASE_URL
Replace it with the pooled connection string above
2. API Key Cleanup
Remove GOOGLE_API_KEY from your environment variables since you have GEMINI_API_KEY (they're for the same service).

The port configuration looks correct, so the deployment failure is likely due to the database connection issue. Try updating the database URL first and redeploy.

now it says its live- but the app shows that - "This plankton-app-zk6x8.ondigitalocean.app page can’t be found

Diagnosed routing configuration issue
Excellent progress! The deployment is now successful (the app is "Live") but you're getting a 404 error. This means the application is running but there's likely an issue with the routing or the app startup.

Let me check the runtime logs to see what's happening:

Checked console and system logs

Assessed DigitalOcean routing issues
I can see from your local Replit logs that the application is working fine (showing 200 responses for / and other routes). The issue seems to be specifically with the DigitalOcean deployment.

This is a routing/startup issue on DigitalOcean. Let's check the runtime logs in your DigitalOcean dashboard:

Next Steps to Debug:
Check DigitalOcean Runtime Logs:

In your DigitalOcean dashboard, click on "Runtime Logs" tab
Look for any errors or startup issues when the application starts
Check if there are any 404 errors when you visit the URL
Verify the Route Configuration:
The most likely issues are:

Your app might not have the main / route properly registered
There could be an import error preventing routes from loading
The application might be starting but not binding to the correct path
Can you share what you see in the "Runtime Logs" tab in DigitalOcean? That will show us exactly what's happening when:

The application starts up
When someone visits https://plankton-app-zk6x8.ondigitalocean.app/
Also, let me check if there are any code issues that could cause the routes not to register properly. The good news is the deployment is now successful - we just need to fix the routing issue!

Diagnosed database connection failures (9 seconds)
Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue from the DigitalOcean runtime logs. The problem is database authentication failure, not routing.

Key Issues Found:
1. Database Password Error (Critical)
ERROR: connection to server at "aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com" (3.111.105.85), port 5432 failed: error received from server in SCRAM exchange: Wrong password
2. Port Configuration Issue
The logs show it's trying to connect to port 5432 instead of 6543 (which is the correct pooled connection port).

3. Missing API Key
WARNING: GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable not set
WARNING: Face analysis routes not found. Face analysis feature will not be available.
Root Cause:
Your database connection string is incorrect. The app can start but database-dependent features fail, causing some routes to not work properly.

Fix Required:
Update your DATABASE_URL in DigitalOcean to:

postgresql://postgres.fzratsdxchvololpzkir:Ashokns-8897@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
Key changes from your current URL:

Port: 5432 → 6543 (pooled connection port)
Username: postgres → postgres.fzratsdxchvololpzkir (full pooled username)
Add SSL: ?sslmode=require at the end
Steps:

Go to DigitalOcean → Settings → Environment Variables
Edit DATABASE_URL
Replace with the corrected URL above
Remove GOOGLE_API_KEY (keep only GEMINI_API_KEY)
Redeploy
The good news is your app and routes are working fine - it's just the database connection that needs fixing!

Chose transaction pooler connection (7 seconds)
Perfect! You should use Supabase's built-in connection options instead of manually entering the URL. This is much better!

What to do:

Select "Transaction pooler" (the second option in your screenshot) - NOT "Direct connection"

I can see it already shows a connection string with port 6543, which is exactly what we need
Keep the Type as "URI" (which is already selected)

Copy the connection string that Supabase shows you for the "Transaction pooler" option

Use that connection string as your DATABASE_URL in DigitalOcean

The Transaction pooler is exactly what you need because:

✅ It uses port 6543 (correct for pooled connections)
✅ It's optimized for applications like yours that need multiple concurrent connections
✅ It's automatically generated by Supabase with the correct credentials
✅ It's more reliable for production deployments
This is actually better than the manual URL I suggested because Supabase ensures all the credentials and formatting are correct for your specific database.

So: Select "Transaction pooler" → Copy the URI → Paste it as your DATABASE_URL in DigitalOcean → Redeploy

still getting same error after doing necessary changes

10 minutes ago

Diagnosed 404 error cause
Let me check the latest runtime logs to see what's happening now after your changes.

Since you're still getting the 404 error, we need to check if the database issue is resolved or if there's a different problem:

Can you please:

Check the latest Runtime Logs in DigitalOcean - Go to your app → Runtime Logs tab and look for the most recent deployment logs
Look for any new error messages about database connections or route registration
The 404 error suggests that either:

The database connection issue still exists and is preventing routes from registering properly
There's a different startup error we need to identify
The deployment didn't pick up your environment variable changes
To help debug this quickly, can you:

Copy the latest few lines from your DigitalOcean Runtime Logs (similar to what you shared before)
Confirm what DATABASE_URL value you set (you can mask the password part)
This will help me see if:

The database connection is now working
The routes are registering successfully
There are any new errors preventing the app from serving requests
The fact that it deployed successfully but gives 404 means the app is running but something is preventing the main route (/) from working.
